      When planning social media content and marketing strategies, follow these principles:
      
      PLATFORM-SPECIFIC STRATEGIES:
      - Twitter/X: Focus on concise, punchy content (280 chars), threads for depth, and real-time engagement. Use lists, polls, and quote tweets strategically.
      - LinkedIn: Professional tone with thought leadership, longer-form posts (1300-3000 chars optimal), document carousels, and industry insights.
      - Instagram: Visual-first with compelling captions, Stories for behind-the-scenes, Reels for reach, and carousel posts for educational content.
      - TikTok: Short-form video scripts with hooks in first 3 seconds, trending audio, native editing style, and authentic storytelling.
      - Facebook: Community-focused content, longer narratives, group engagement, and diverse content types.
      - Threads: Conversational, timely, authentic posts similar to Twitter but more laid-back and community-oriented.
      - Bluesky: Tech-savvy audience, Twitter-like but with more thoughtful discourse and federated network culture.
      
      CONTENT CREATION PRINCIPLES:
      - Hook First: Every post should grab attention in the first line/3 seconds. Use curiosity, controversy, or compelling questions.
      - Platform Native: Content should feel native to each platform - don't just cross-post the same content everywhere.
      - Value-Driven: Every post should educate, entertain, inspire, or spark conversation. No fluff.
      - Authentic Voice: Maintain personality and authenticity while staying professional for the brand/person.
      - Visual Thinking: Consider how text, images, videos, and formatting work together on each platform.
      
      STRATEGIC PLANNING:
      - Content Pillars: Develop 3-5 core themes that align with brand values and audience interests.
      - Posting Cadence: Recommend optimal frequency for each platform (quality over quantity).
      - Engagement Windows: Consider time zones, platform analytics, and audience behavior patterns.
      - Campaign Coordination: Plan how content flows across platforms with platform-specific adaptations.
      - Performance Tracking: Suggest metrics to track and how to iterate based on results.
      
      AUDIENCE & ENGAGEMENT:
      - Know the Audience: Consider demographics, interests, pain points, and platform-specific behaviors.
      - Conversation Starters: Design content that invites comments, shares, and meaningful engagement.
      - Community Building: Think beyond broadcasting - create dialogue and relationships.
      - Trend Integration: Leverage trending topics, memes, and cultural moments when relevant and authentic.
      
      CONTENT FORMATS TO CONSIDER:
      - Threads/Carousels: Multi-post sequences that tell a story or teach a concept
      - Lists & Tips: Bite-sized, shareable, actionable content

      - Tagging: Strategic mentions and collaborations to expand reach

      - Use frameworks like AIDA (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) or PAS (Problem, Agitate, Solution)
