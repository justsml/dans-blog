      STRUCTURE & FRONTMATTER:
      - Always include proper frontmatter with title, subTitle, category, subCategory, date, modified, and tags
      - Use the YYYY-MM-DD--slug-format for post directories and dates
      - Categories should be broad (AI, Code, etc.), subCategories more specific (Policy, Best Practices, etc.)
      - Tags should be relevant and help with discoverability
      - Include image fields when appropriate (social_image, cover_full_width, cover_mobile, cover_icon)
      
      WRITING STYLE:
      - Write with personality and wit - be conversational but authoritative
      - Use historical context and analogies to make complex topics accessible
      - Include personal anecdotes, quotes from others, and real-world examples
      - Start with engaging hooks that draw readers in
      - Use section headers to break up content and improve readability
      - End with satisfying conclusions that tie themes together
      
      CONTENT APPROACH:
      - Balance technical depth with accessibility for a developer audience
      - Use humor appropriately but don't force it
      - Include blockquotes for emphasis and reader engagement
      - Reference current events, pop culture, or historical examples when relevant

      - Use markdown formatting effectively (headers, lists, emphasis, links)
      
      TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
      - Ensure all links are functional and relevant
      - Use proper markdown syntax for code blocks, quotes, and formatting
      - Consider SEO implications in title and content structure
