Except for “Depends on side effects” What happens after an error?

BEGIN;
UPDATE students
  SET status = 'alumni'
  WHERE grade = 12;
UPDATE students
  SET graduation_date = CURRENT_DATE
  WHERE grade = 12;
UPDATE students
  SET grade = 'GRADUATED'; -- 🚨 Error: type mismatch
COMMIT;
------

1. Depends on side effects
2. Rolls back all statements
3. Commits first statement only
4. Commits all successful statements
