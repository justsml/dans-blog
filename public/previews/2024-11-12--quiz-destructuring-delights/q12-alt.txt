# 12. TypeScript + Assignment

Now with assignment (note the f, l and p variables)

'use strict';
function greet(
  {
    name: {first: f = "N/A", last: l = "N/A"},
    birth: {place: p = "N/A"} = {},
    age = -1,
  }: {
    name: {first?: string, last?: string};
    birth?: {place?: string};
    age?: number;
  }
) {
  console.log(`Hi ${f} ${l} from ${place}`);
  // What will ðŸ‘† do?
}
greet({
  name: {first: 'Dan', last: 'Levy'},
  birth: {place: 'Cape Town'},
});
