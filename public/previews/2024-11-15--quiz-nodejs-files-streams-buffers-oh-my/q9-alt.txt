# 9. File System

How many times will the callback fire when a file is modified?

import fs from 'fs';
fs.watch('test.txt', (eventType, filename) => {
  console.log(`${filename} was changed`);
});
// Then modify test.txt once
------

1. Once per file change
2. Twice per file change
3. Never
4. Only on file deletion
