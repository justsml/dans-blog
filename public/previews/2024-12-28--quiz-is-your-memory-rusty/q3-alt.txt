# 3. Borrowing

What happens with multiple mutable references?

fn main() {
    let mut wisdom = String::from("He who laughs at");
    let ref1 = &mut wisdom;  // First mutable borrow
    let ref2 = &mut wisdom;  // Second mutable borrow
    ref1.push_str(" himself never runs");
    ref2.push_str(" out of things to laugh at.");
}

Think about Rustâ€™s rules for mutable references.
------

1. Compiles successfully
2. Error: cannot borrow `wisdom` as mutable more than once
3. Error: missing lifetime specifier
4. Runtime panic
