# 12. RefCell

Whatâ€™s the key difference between RefCell and RwLock in Rust?

Consider these examples:

use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::sync::RwLock;


// Example 1
let data = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
let borrowed = data.borrow_mut();


// Example 2
let shared = RwLock::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
let locked = shared.write().unwrap();
------

1. RefCell is used for mutable borrows, Rw for immutable
2. Rw is used for mutable borrows, RefCell for immutable
3. RefCell and Rw are used for the same purpose
4. RefCell is only used for single-threaded environments
5. Rw is only used for multi-threaded environments
