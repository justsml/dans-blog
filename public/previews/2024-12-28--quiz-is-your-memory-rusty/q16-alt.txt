# 16. Design Patterns

What happens when we clone this Philosophy struct?

#[derive(Clone)]
struct Philosophy {
    school: String,
    founder: String,
}


fn main() {
    let stoicism = Philosophy {
        school: String::from("Stoicism"),
        founder: String::from("Zeno of Citium")
    };
    let new_school = stoicism.clone();
    println!("{} - {}",
        stoicism.school, new_school.school);
}
------

1. Compilation Error
2. Deep copy created
3. Shallow copy created
4. Move semantics applied
