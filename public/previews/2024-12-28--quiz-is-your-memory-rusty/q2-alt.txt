# 2. Ownership

What happens when you run this code? Think about ownership transfer:

fn take_knowledge(knowledge: String) {
    println!("Knowledge: {}", knowledge);
}


fn main() {
    let wisdom = String::from("know thyself");
    take_knowledge(wisdom);
    // What happens to our wisdom?
    println!("Do you {}", wisdom);
}
------

1. Prints both lines
2. Prints first line only
3. Compilation Error
4. Runtime Error
