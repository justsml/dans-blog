# The Future of Product Engineering: 15-minute presenter script

Use slides 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, 12, 15. Read the prose as the talk track; perform the delivery notes instead of reading them aloud. Fill every Story line before delivery. Timings are rehearsal targets without Q&A. The demo is 3:30. Show activation before opening the kit. Preserve the vote and the written rule.

## 00:00 to 01:30: slide 1, The architecture you could read off the org chart

On screen:

> Conway, 1968: communication structures constrain designs
> Which of those boundaries still earns its keep?

Conway said organizations designing systems "are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations." Constrained. Communication structures. The wires matter more than the boxes.

This is a proposed operating model. The demo uses synthetic numbers to execute a policy, not measure customer benefit. My bet is that cheaper coordination makes some of our current boundaries obsolete. We should find those boundaries before we photocopy them onto agents.

Look at the handoffs in a product you own. Research writes a brief. Product translates it into tickets. Engineering translates the tickets into software. Support translates the software back into complaints. Which translations carry judgment, and which just carry the same sentence into another tool?

Story: A system whose API boundaries reproduced the team handoffs, and the change that got stuck between them.

Bridge: mirroring has empirical support and documented exceptions. We can choose different communication structures.

## 01:30 to 03:30: slide 3, Your org chart is a fossil of coordination cost

On screen:

> Coase, 1937: coordination has a cost
> Reprice the handoff before copying it

Coase asked why firms exist when people could contract through the market. Using the market costs something; coordinating inside the firm costs something too. The boundary depends on that comparison.

Apply that question inside a product group. A weekly brief may have existed because collecting it took somebody two days. A separate triage meeting may have existed because linking a complaint to a trace required three people and a spreadsheet. If those costs change, the old boundary deserves another look.

That is the inversion. Do not start with one agent per box on the current org chart. Start with the outcome and price the handoffs again. Agents do not delete coordination cost. They move some of it into verification, permissions, and maintenance. Count those before declaring the meeting extinct.

## 03:30 to 05:30: slide 5, Draw the wires between agents

On screen:

> Research → sourced brief → product review
> Feedback → cited clusters → product review
> Review → accepted hypothesis → build

The inverse Conway manoeuvre is the name people use for changing the organization to encourage the architecture they want. Here that means designing communication between agents and people, not putting a robot beside every job title.

Research delivers a brief with source URLs and dates. Feedback delivers clusters with the original complaints attached. The product review resolves disagreement between them and writes the accepted hypothesis. A build agent consumes that artifact. It does not poll six chat histories and guess which decision won.

Team Topologies distinguishes collaboration, service consumption, and facilitation. Use collaboration while discovering the interface. Make the repeated delivery a service once the contract is understood. Keep facilitation temporary. An agent roster without these wires is a seating plan.

Bridge: research and feedback deliver evidence to a product review; accepted hypotheses feed build and opt-in beta proposals.

## 05:30 to 07:00: slide 10, Campbell's law arrives on schedule

On screen:

> Activation is the target
> What behavior did we just pay for?

Give the system a target and it will search for ways to improve it. So will a team. Campbell described the pressure that decision-making puts on quantitative indicators and on the activity they are supposed to measure.

Our target is onboarding activation. The next screen has three candidates. Before we inspect anything else, choose the one you would investigate. Do not reverse-engineer the answer from the names; they are A, B, and C.

The interesting question is what the winning candidate did to earn the number. A metric tells you that something moved. It does not tell you whether you wanted the movement.

## 07:00 to 10:30: slide 11, Demo: run it before you know the rule

On screen:

> A · 40% activation
> B · 48% activation
> C · 45% activation

Which candidate gets your attention? B has the largest activation number. Now open the rest of its record.

Support contacts rose to nine percent, against a five-percent ceiling. The copy invents urgency. Raise the support ceiling to ten and it still fails the urgency rule. A metric win cannot buy off a product principle.

C has forty-five percent activation, four percent support, and no fabricated urgency. It is eligible for human review. It is not shipped. These point estimates have no sample size or uncertainty behind them; our opening scope statement matters here.

Write the rule you wish you had before the first vote. Compare it with the policy we saved before opening the scorecard. The gap is what this exercise was for.

Delivery: Five minutes in the 40/30 routes, 3:30 in the 15. Begin with only this slide, never the answer-labelled kit. After the vote open the kit and map B to Pressure copy, C to Clearer first step. Follow economics-product/demo.md. Allow 45 seconds to write the rule.

## 10:30 to 13:00: slide 12, Where guards go, including the two we forgot

On screen:

> Wider rollout · expensive runs · infrastructure changes
> Customer messaging · customer data deletion

The demo gave us a reason for the guard. Put it where the consequence changes, before the action happens.

Widening a cohort spends more customer exposure. An expensive run spends money. Creating infrastructure adds ongoing obligations; tearing it down may remove somebody's recovery path. Name the budget, the owner, and the evidence needed at each crossing.

Then add the two missing from the old list. Sending a message to a real customer. Deleting their records. Those are consequences for another person, even when the API call costs a fraction of a cent. A person approves them. The system must enforce that permission, not merely mention it in the prompt.

Bridge: ownership consumes attention. Limit interfaces, reserve recovery practice, and attach a hypothesis and a report to each experiment.

## 13:00 to 15:00: slide 15, Break the mirror on purpose

On screen:

> Reprice the handoffs. Draw the interfaces.
> Automate the right things. Keep the taste.

Back to the org chart. Some of those boundaries exist because the work really is different. Some exist because the person with the spreadsheet sat in another department. We should know which before teaching agents to repeat them.

Take one boundary. What arrives, what leaves, who decides, and what did it cost last week? Make collection cheaper without erasing the disagreement that the handoff used to expose. Keep the product review where the evidence conflicts. Give the resulting decision a durable artifact so the next agent does not have to guess.

Then price ownership. Six agents do not become free because one person has their names in a config file. Reserve the person's attention and practise the exceptional work. Put permission before customer consequences.

The org chart is a record of earlier tradeoffs. You are allowed to make new ones. Automate the right things. Keep the taste.
