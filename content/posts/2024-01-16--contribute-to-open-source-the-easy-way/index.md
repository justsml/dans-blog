Hell yea! Let me know if you ever find it. 🤙

## The Reality

If you want to **_`contribute`_** to Open Source, and you’ve struggled to get started, keep reading...

Over my career, I’ve written many PR’s for dozens of 10,000-Star repositories. My modest contributions have landed in Node.js, Docker, Lodash, Bluebird, Gatsby, Rancher, Angular, React Router, Minio, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) and many more.

I'm going to share my secret to banging out slick contributions, but first we need to discuss the problems with the conventional advice.

## This is (Not) The Way

Why is it difficult to **_`contribute`_** to Open Source?

The most common advice actually falls somewhere between useless-to-terrible: Find a `GFI` issue (`Good First Issue` label) and solve it. Or, contribute to a project out of sheer love.

It's all well-intentioned, however in practice `GFI` labels are highly subjective, and often obscure an unknowable number of steps.

## A Better Way

<!-- ❌ Don't look outward, look inward. -->

<!-- ❌ Searching GitHub Repo Issues pages for a `good first issue`. That's reasonable in scope. Also interesting. And hasn't been claimed by someone else. And isn't hiding impossible complexity.

👎 When Searching Repos, you may lack any context, and the issue may be too complex for you to easily solve. -->

✅ Scan your project dependency file(s). Which libraries spark rage? What led to a missed deadline? How did you overcome it?

💪 By starting with something you already solved, there's **no need to worry if you can.** You're already **fluent; and familiar** with the context!

<!-- The Struggle is the Way: Every project or library you’ve ever struggled with could become an "easy" contribution! -->

By definition, **you already solved the thing, most of the work is done.**

Next, figure out how to **help others avoid your struggle altogether.**

Maybe a Tweet or Stack Overflow answer will do, but if you want to make a **lasting impact, _`contribute`_ to the project itself.**

<!-- However, if you want the glory that lives forever: help others avoid your struggle in the first place. -->

## The Glory

Preferably while the experience is somewhat fresh, contemplate how your _dumb dumb_ brain got so lost in the first place.

What did you try **first?** And why? What did you assume? Or misunderstand?

💪 You don't need to come up with a perfect solution, often simple documentation updates can save countless hours of struggle for others.

- An outdated README? Missing or bad examples? Omitted setup steps? _Simple fix, include any missing info!_

- Did the API documentation not show up in your Google results. _Adjust or translate overly technical language._

- Perhaps it’s a technical oversight, and the docs site is missing necessary `<meta/>` tags. _Fix it if you know how, or write a ticket with your findings._

- If it's a skill issue, _propose adding appropriate links to relevant resources._

These types of issues are easy for maintainers to miss! And can have surprisingly big impact on the project & its users.

Think about it this way: how would you feel if you knew that sharing your fix might save 100’s (or 100,000’s) of devs from countless lost hours?

Next time you conquer some challenge, _don’t rebase away evidence of your inadequacy!_
**Instead share your struggle & solution publicly!**

## Fine, Fine Print

Always follow project guidelines, and never be an asshole. ✨

It’s all public. So, be gracious, great, and grateful.

If you need any more convincing: `contribute` for the learning! New processes, languages, frameworks, automation!

> Perhaps even more importantly, you can **quickly advance your communication skills!** The ability to advocate for your ideas can change your life!
