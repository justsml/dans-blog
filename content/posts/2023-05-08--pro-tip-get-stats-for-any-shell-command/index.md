As you may have noticed, the commands `time` and `gtime` are different!

`time` is a common shell builtin (in ZSH, Bash, etc), and `gnu-time` is a GNU utility with far more details.

You can install it on MacOS with `brew install gnu-time`. On Linux, you can 'override' the builtin shell alias by using `/usr/bin/time`. The [`gnu-time` manual has some helpful](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/) platform-specific instructions.

Thanks to my colleague Kevin McCormack for introducing me to [gnu-time](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/)!
