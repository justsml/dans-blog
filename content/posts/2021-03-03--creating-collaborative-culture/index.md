# Creating Collaborative Culture

## What is *Collaborative Culture*?

*Collaborative Culture* describes organizations where:

- All ideas are celebrated! Even silly ones.
- People are empowered to contribute ideas & solutions across the organization.
- Ideas & input are welcome from anyone - regardless of rank or role.


The best organizations welcome all ideas, from any rank and without prejudice.

## Why *Collaborative Culture*?

One of my favorite examples is the incredible [story of Richard Montañez](https://thehustle.co/hot-cheetos-inventor/), an immigrant & janitor at Frito-Lay who created the multi-billion dollar "Flamin' Hot" brand of snacks. 
When PepsiCo's CEO, Roger Enrico, implored his employees to **"act like an owner"** few employees took him seriously.

Montañez knew there was an untapped market for spicy snacks, and decided to share his idea. So, he simply called the CEO's number from the company directory, and asked for a meeting. Due to some fortuitous confusion, they setup the meeting thinking it was with the regional Plant Manager. The Plant Manager was understandably a bit surprised to hear about the upcoming meeting, and after some choice words, told Montañez it was his chance to sink or swim - and to never pull a stunt like that again.

**Montañez went on to become a VP of Sales, generating billions for PepsiCo.** His incredible story was made possible thanks to a *Collaborative Culture*.

In a sense the cultural & language barriers Montañez faced were a freedom from the rules - he didn't realize he was expected to "stay in his lane."


## Next Steps

As they say *Collaborative Culture* isn't the destination, it's the journey.

The first steps along that journey are fairly easy! 

Spend a few moments to reflect on some important questions:

* What % of the organization shares ideas?
* How quickly after being hired?
* How often?

More personally:

* What's the last idea that a colleague brought to you?
* How did you respond? Did you empower them? Did you take the time to listen? And hopefully give them credit?
* Do colleagues feel comfortable to bring you their next idea?
