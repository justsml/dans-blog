I think we are witnessing the Python 2->3 'Conversion' all over again.
AngularJS v2.0 introduces too many changes. **Not least of which is TypeScript**, which is a big ask amidst the finalization of JS's latest version: ES6.

While TypeScript compiles to JavaScript, it doesn't mean you blindly copy & paste 'compiled' TypeScript. It effectively becomes required learning, as to understand annotated AngularJS 2.0 TypeScript.

Now, newbies must climb 'Mount TypeScript' before they can even start assembling an Angular app (with some level of understanding).

I have a feeling how this might go...

Oh well, I'll add it to the Newbie training list: somewhere between `Basic Shell Usage` and `Gulp or Grunt? Godsend+Misery!`
