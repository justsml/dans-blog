# Outline

Daily feedback from team members or students may seem unmanageable.

However it is the single most important tool I found in maintaining healthy classroom.

When a feedback loop is done well, it will save your organization so much pain from unseen corrosive and harmful patterns.

## Critical Requirements

- Promise to ***review*** ALL feedback; and ***RESPOND*** to ALL critiques. AND DO IT.
    - **TODO: Feasibility notes**
- Max 3 questions per survey. (You can rotate your questions.)
- Max 1 free-text field.
- All fields optional.
- Ideal structure: 2 "simple" fields, and 1 open text field. ("Simple" as in: yes/no checkbox, 1-3 stars, emoji picker, etc.)
    - "How was the lesson today?" **üëç/üëé**
    - "Are you learning effectively from provided resources, peers and teachers?" **1-3 stars.**
    - "Please share any comments, critiques, kudos or thoughts from the day:"

## Handling Critical Feedback

Negative feedback is a bit like radioactive waste. Without care and attention, well, you're gonna have a bad time.

However it's not necessarily bad, in fact it's really an important opportunity!

As a leader you have a chance to handle whatever negativity may be lurking. This is the time to take some action: own your mistakes, clearly communicate resolution or next steps.

- Identify between *critical* versus *normal* waste. (Reactor meltdown vs. spent rods).
- Ignore either at your peril.
- Ignoring or delaying "cleanup" risks far worse long-term damage.
- Must handle with clear protocol, consistently.


- What I needed to get out of it was **no more than 3 takeaways**
- The high-level  that would let me show to the students I that I would mention before starting the next lecture.
