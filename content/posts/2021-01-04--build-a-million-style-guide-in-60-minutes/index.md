## Getting Serious About Branding

Every Product or Brand needs a Style Guide. Preferably a good one.

~~Style Guides typically include logos, colors, spacing, sizing and yes, even the amount of Comic-sans. (The correct amount is zero.)~~

The difference in design budgets between small & large companies can seem insurmountable. Nike can spend $10's of millions of dollars to launch a product, while many companies get by with a Zip Disk from 2006 labelled "designz" from the CEO's nephew.

Even if you have a design team crafting your brand & look, you will need to "bridge the gap" over to the development team.


## That's what developers are for, right?

Most teams make this mistake: they write custom components. You may have heard the rationalizations, "it's only a button, how hard can it be to code?"

What if I told you that you could have a $10,000,000 design system in under an hour? was a way to add a complete Style Guide, Components and Documentation?

Including the work of 1,000's of designers & engineers?!

I'm going to show you how to get started for free!

The problem with most style guides is, integrating them into product development is difficult and tends to be the weak over time.


## Now what?

Every company should have a robust "Style Guide" that developers can follow. Ideally specifying fonts, colors, sizes, spacing, etc. One way to ensure it's used is to include ready-to-use code or library Components (like `NavBar`, `DropDownMenu`, `Button`, etc.)

The thing is, building a comprehensive "Style Guide" takes a lot of effort. Like, a *metric fuck-ton.* 

Inevitably you'll run into issues, either development or design fall out of sync, or it will become difficult to use & maintain. Implementing, documenting and testing actual components takes even more work designs is often another well-spring of tears.

This ranges from minimal to elaborate & comprehensive. 
Minimal is rarely more than a CSS file named `theme.css` with 3-colors and their preferred font - probably `Comic Sans`.

More elaborate examples may include full documentation, component library and examples. Some go into theory or cognitive impact of the design decisions. You may find details on using negative space with screenshots & examples.

## Identify a Robust *Existing* Component Library

### Pitch

> Get a complete set of UI Components for free!* âœ¨

**We can save 1,000's of hours of effort in development, QA, UI/UX, Product! (and more roles I'm sure!)**

- Up until recently it made a lot of sense to "roll your own" UI Components.

- However this is no longer the case, there are many robust design systems which are highly customizable, well-documented, tested broadly across devices & languages!

- These Systems (i.e. [Material *Design*](https://material.io/design/introduction#goals)) specify the requirements for anyone Component libraries for major frameworks (React, Vue, etc.) For example [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) is the React component library for Material Design.

**- Eliminate future regressions by eliminating our custom UI library.** High quality ****UI Component Libraries are a well-solved problem.

So instead of crafting an artisanal "SetPagePreview" with custom 

### High Level Pros/Cons

#### Pros

- Unified app design.
- Devs can focus effort on more meaningful work.

### Options

Generate a component site by using the prior work of popular UI libraries:

1. [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/components/card/) / [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/card/)
2. [SemanticUI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/modules/dropdown/)
3. [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com/components/cards/)
    1. Native support.
4. [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/index.html)

TailwindCSS based libraries:

### Attempt #1: MaterialUI

Material UI is one of the most popular, and broadly tested, React Component libraries.

It features extensive tests, impressive documentation, accessibility support, and much more.

#### Pros

- Theming is easily customized.
- Pre-built, robust design system as starting point.
- Unified Web & Native design system (Android+iOS).
- 

#### Cons
