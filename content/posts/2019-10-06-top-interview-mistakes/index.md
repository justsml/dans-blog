My name is [Dan Levy](/about/). I've helped teach over 750+ students and I've conducted over 500 practice interviews, white-board workshops and interview role-play exercises.

<!-- Some students endured 5-6 interview exercises with me. Some days I'd conduct 10+ interviews or exercises, varying 30-60 minute blocks. -->

I've also been involved in 100s of "real" interviews over my professional software development career (20+ years.)

# Top Mistakes

1. [Going Negative](#1-going-negative)
1. [Failing at Failure](#2-failing-at-failure)
1. [Being Disinterested](#3-being-disinterested)



## 1. Going Negative

Sounding negative is all too easy. We've all done it. Sometimes we're kidding. Sometimes it's observant.

We're well practiced at using negativity in socially appropriate familiar settings.

However in less familiar & high-stress settings, like a job interview, people seem to almost **universally overestimate their ability to control their negativity.** 

<!-- Especially when discussing your craft or hobbies. The sort of endeavour which you have dedicated countless hours developing your personal preferences & methods.
Combine this with the high-stakes stress during an interview and it becomes easier to see  -->

#### Going negative risks showing...

* hatred or contempt for the line of work, company, tools, or processes,
* less experience by missing the potential silver lining,
* stubbornly held mis-conceptions,
* or unqualified assumptions.

### Recommendations

Has an interviewer ever asked you to defend a decision?

> _"Can you tell me why you chose to use **X**? Did you consider **Y** and **Z**?"_

❌ **Meh:** "Because I don't know **Y** or **Z**."

❌ **Meh:** "I didn't learn about other options **Y** and **Z**."

✅ **Energized:** "I recently learned about **X**, and am excited to learn about **Y** and **Z**!"

✅ **Curious:** "I found **X** met my requirements. Can you tell me more about your requirements?"

✅ **Wise:** "Option **X** was a great learning experience. I'm looking forward to learning about other options and their trade-offs."



## 2. Failing at Failure

How you respond to failure says a lot about you.

Consider this: it's possible to **fail at every interview question** and still **get an offer**!

<!-- If a candidate shows a growth mindset and resilience to failure, I'd consider them a high-priority candidate. Furthermore, I'll circulate their resume with other hiring managers at my company. -->

**How?** 

#### Well, let's consider what I want to know as an interviewer...

* How do you handle high-stress situations? 
    * Are you a `Blame-first`? `Panic-first`? `Observe-first`? Or `Solve-first` sort of person?
* Do you learn from mistakes? 
    * How so? Did you seek _and_ adopt feedback? Utilize root-cause analysis?
* Can you discuss failings positively? 
    * Without being bitter? Or shifting blame?


## 3. Being Disinterested
