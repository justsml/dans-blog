  <h1>My Contribution Log</h1>

  <blockquote class="inset">
    I wish I could say I contribute to open source out of some noble, altruistic
    spirit‚Äîbut really, it's just FDD: <b>Frustration-Driven Development.</b>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Let's face it: nothing lights a fire under me like a piece of software
    that's determined to ruin my day. Sure, I like the idea of giving back to
    the community, but it's usually less ‚Äúpaying it forward‚Äù and more ‚Äúoh, for
    the love of all that is good, why hasn't anyone fixed this yet?‚Äù
  </p>
  <p>
    The urge becomes hard to ignore when I've been using the software long enough
    to develop Stockholm Syndrome. And don't even get me started on repeat
    offenders. You know the ones: you Google a weird new error, only to find a
    sea of purple visited links. <em>Who's been using my machine?!?</em> 
  </p>
  <p>
    Sometimes, it's less about fixing the problem and more about exorcising the
    ghost of every poor soul who's Googled their way into an ancient, abandoned
    repo full of outdated <code>log4j</code> install instructions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, here's a list of contributions I could recall from my 15+ years of
    open-source escapades. It's by no means comprehensive‚Äîjust the ones that
    didn't get lost in the chaos of FDD. Enjoy!
