# The `Priority` Dropdown Trap

<aside className="breakout">
💡 As an organization grows, it will inevitably have a ballooning backlog. Eventually, the size of the list will *demand* prioritization.
</aside>

## A Startup Story

Without fail, your Jira Admins will have a solution: behold a `Priority` field dropdown! (Pro tip enterprise devs: possibly named `Priority2` or `P-level`.)

Curiously, 100% of companies choose between  `P1, P2, P3, P4` or `Low, Med, High, and Critical` — apparently there are no other options.

A hard-coded list of four options? Okay. Let's try it for a few weeks...

### 2 Days Later

In a *shocking-to-no-one* turn of events, the organization discovered a ticket with a new, higher priority, necessitating a minor hack: adding `P0`, or `Critical Max+`!

### 3 More Days

*Our intrepid boss had some exciting meetings & discoveries at the conference!* 

Somehow they uncovered an even higher priority than `P0`!

Since then, the team has been heads-down researching how to label this new Priority.

Maybe `-1`? No, no. That's too confusing (`P-1` vs. `P1`). Ok, how about `P0.5`, no?

<p className="breakout">In an "inspired" moment, the team invented a higher priority: the double-zero!<br />Now known as the `P00` Priority.</p>

{/* *Finally, we can neatly label everything in the world into our Priorities dropdown! (…evil laugh…)* */}

### Before the Flood

Before anyone realizes it, your team is somehow drowning in `P00` tickets!

<b>How can we avoid this silly game of Engineering Theater?</b>

## What if Priority Wasn't Multiple Choice?

How could we better represent an ever-changing, fluid human concept like `Priority`?

- In the real world, priorities constantly shift and evolve based on new information, market changes, and organizational goals.
- There's often a complex interplay between urgency, importance, resource availability, and cost/risk analysis that a simple dropdown can't capture, especially over time. (Ticket rot.)
- Different stakeholders may have conflicting views on what constitutes a high priority, making a one-size-fits-all approach unsuitable.

## So, what next?

There are several alternative approaches worth exploring, from low to high effort:

- To provide more leg and headroom, pick a “neutral” starting value, say 100 or 1,000. You can always increase or decrease the number.
    - Or stick with zero to start, where higher numbers have higher priority.
- Implement a multidimensional prioritization system that considers factors like business value, urgency, and effort required. (Create a `composite` score to make sorting and filtering easier.)
- Adopt a dynamic prioritization method, such as the [MoSCoW technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method) (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have), allowing regular reassessment. (See also the [Kano Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kano_model).)

## Summary

So much is put on Priority despite its rapid rate of decay. Yesterday's `CRITICAL` tickets are not likely to be next quarter's `CRITICAL` tickets.

Over time, older high-priority tickets become resistant to cleanup and maintenance. After all, who wants to lower the `Priority` of something once declared ***essential***? Never mind deleting said irrelevant tickets… (Gasp! Think of the backlog!)

I've seen multiple companies mix up `Severity` & `Priority`. `Severity` describes ***urgency*** (or time-sensitivity.)

`Priority ≠ Severity`. It can make sense to define 3-5 severity levels (often used to maintain Service Level Agreements.) 

The levels of urgency help communicate `zero customer impact` to a `partial/complete service outage`.

## A word of caution

Deploying an unbounded Priority field requires a little planning & discipline!

If you are familiar with front-end development, you may have experienced a `z-index` war.

Essentially, `z-index` lets designers set *any* positive integer to ensure their widgets show “above” other lower `z-index` content.

Even a minor component update could introduce a change to the z-index on their `<Dialog />` - making it suddenly invisible.  These situations could become messy as our third-party components, feature work, and other team contributions tried to out-`z-index` each other.

`Z-index` was once limited to ~32,000. However, I recently saw a snippet with a billion `z-index: 1000000000`!

Inflation must be hitting `z-index` hard.

## Discuss

- Is this a worthy thought experiment?
- Is the idea of an ever-increasing Priority horrifying? Anxiety inducing?
- Is it inevitable that this approach eventually exceeds 64-bit integer limits?
- Can other fields (beyond `Severity` or `Urgency`) add to this conversation?
- How much blame does Jira deserve? Or credit?

We could scream into the internet, “Who's going to clean all these `P00` tix?”

Or, you can get ***real*** about your backlog.

- Accept that 90% of your 1,000 tickets will never get done. It's ok.
- Archive tickets that have been untouched for months. Any initial priority/urgency is no longer applicable. Anyway, archived issues can often be retrieved.
- When an issue comes back, that's cool; it just increased its priority.
- Anecdotally, I've noticed zero harm from discarding older & incomplete tickets.
- Endlessly appending to a backlog-as-database misses the opportunity to focus your team & organization on what matters. (Things ahead of us. Whereas backlogs inherently look backward.)
- A deep backlog ends up like a Bizzaro Trophy Room, celebrating the shit you'll never ship.
