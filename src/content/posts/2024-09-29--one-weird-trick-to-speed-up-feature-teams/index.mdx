When designing a new system or feature, it's easy to get bogged down on schema design. In this article I will share a neat trick that has paid dividends over my career.

<section class="breakout">
  _Try_ the simplest possible data persistence when designing a new system or feature.
</section>

All too often, I see teams reach for SQL or MongoDB as their only choice for data storage. Sure, no one's getting fired for choosing SQL. But what if I told you there's a simpler, faster, and cheaper way to start?

A KV or Key-value store might be all you need. Something like Redis or S3.

It's not always the right choice, but perhaps **more often than you realize.**

A simple storage layer can moderately speed up *early* development by reusing data-layer code and avoiding costs related to churn in schema design and migrations. Churn will happen anyway; let the code deal with it as long as possible. Better to avoid dealing with changes in two places.

Performance gains are likely since `key` lookups are highly optimized, and writes can benefit from batched updates.

{/* Avoid KV patterns if you need JOINs or to query by properties in your dataset. Or in cases where you have an unbounded/infinitely growing datasets. (`Logs`, `Signups`, etc.) */}

## Thinking in Keys

It can feel strange to design with a Key-Value pattern first, especially if you're used to designing systems with object hierarchies or Entity Relationship Diagrams and directly implementing them in SQL.

You've probably ***used*** key-value patterns before! They are everywhere, from configs and URLs to S3-style Object Storage! Every time you deal with data via a unique `ID` value, guess what? Another Key-value pattern! (Though not necessarily a KV Store.)

### Designing with Keys

Virtually all data _can_ be represented using KV patterns. (In fact, many higher-order DBs build on lower-level KV patterns.) Let's look at some examples:

```markdown
user/123          {id: 123, ...}
user/123/block    ['user/456', 'user/789']
user/123/groups   ['admin', 'staff']
user/420/friends  ['user/456', 'user/789']

group/admin       {user: '*:rw'}
group/default     {user: '*:r'}

product/42/discount/<UUID>	{percentOff: '10%'}
product/42/discount/<UUID>	{percentOff: '20%', minTotal: 100.0}
```

You may have noticed, but the `ID` is often a key in itself! This is a common pattern in KV stores. The key is often a composite of the entity type and the unique identifier. (e.g `user/123`, `user:456`)

### KVs as Graphs & Trees?

It can be helpful to represent complex data structures like Graphs or Trees using KV patterns. (Again, REST URLs are a great example of this.)

The key hierarchy (`user/420` -> `user/420/friends`) naturally encodes a graph relationship between the `user` and their `friends`.

This is a quick & cheap way to serialize graph data structures. Especially if you don't need the complexity of a graph database (like Neo4j).

### When to Use KV Patterns

- When you need massive scale. (Billions or even trillions of KV pairs.)
- When you primarily access data via a unique key.
- When you need simple data structures.
- When you have data with a hierarchy, graph, or tree structure.

### When to Avoid KV Patterns

Don't store things like blog comments in a _**single**_ KV pair. For example, `post/666 -> {comments: [...too many...]}`. Instead you might use `post/666/comments/1`, or `post/666/comments/<UUID>`, etc. Or go for a SQL table.

- When you need to search by properties (not Key or ID) in your dataset.
- When you need to JOIN data across multiple entities.
- When you need to enforce complex constraints or relationships.

### When you need more than KV

As project requirements naturally evolve, you may need to do more than your KV store supports. At this point you'll need to look at migrating to a more complex data store.

{/* The good news is that you can often start with a KV pattern and evolve it into a more complex system as needed. S3 has features beyond simple storage, from Athena for searching files, Glacier, and Expire policies there's a lot you can do with it. Also, Redis has added many high-level features (like Pub/Sub, Geo-spatial, Streams, and Sorted Sets) that can help you meet some requirements. */}

The good news is that migrating a single KV store to SQL is relatively easier than migrating a complex SQL schema into a KV store. (With multiple tables, indexes, constraints, etc.) I've done this many times with a 50-line script.

Anecdotally, I've found the quality of SQL designs is higher if you start with a KV pattern first. It forces you to really think about the data in a different way, and better understand _exactly_ what you really need from SQL.

## Next Steps

The best way to learn is to try it out! If you're interested in exploring this pattern further, I recommend **building things** with Redis, DynamoDB or S3.
All are excellent KV stores with different trade-offs.

### Fact Service - Reference Project

Check out my Open Source ["Fact Service," a reference project on GitHub](https://github.com/justsml/fact-service).

It's a stand-alone RESTful API that implements a KV data service.

It features many [data adapters](https://github.com/justsml/fact-service/tree/main/lib/providers).
Including for Postgres, Redis, DynamoDB, Firestore, and Cassandra! (Complete with [Docker commands](https://github.com/justsml/fact-service/tree/main/lib/providers) to get started quickly.)

Fact Service is meant to be a starter & learning project, fork it and build your own KV data service!
