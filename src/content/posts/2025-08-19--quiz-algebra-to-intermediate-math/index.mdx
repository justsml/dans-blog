Ready to flex those math muscles? This isn't your high school teacher's boring algebra quiz – we're serving up 16 questions that'll test whether you actually remember how to wrangle equations or if you've been faking it this whole time.

From basic "solve for x" problems (spoiler: it's probably not 42 this time) to funkier function composition that'll make your brain do backflips, we're covering the greatest hits of algebra through intermediate math. Think of it as a mathematical obstacle course, but with less mud and more variables.

Fair warning: some questions have extra wrong answers thrown in just to keep you on your toes. Because why make it easy when we can make it *interesting*?

### 16 Questions That'll Either Boost Your Ego or Humble You Real Quick

    Classic isolation technique! Add 7 to both sides (3x = 15), then divide by 3 to get x = 5. Sorry folks, it's not 42 this time – that's the answer to life, the universe, and everything, not this equation.

    Time to play matchmaker with your terms! Group the x² terms (3x² + 2x² = 5x²), the x terms (4x - 2x = 2x), and the constants (-1 + 4 = 3). Result: 5x² + 2x + 3. It's like organizing your sock drawer, but with algebra.

    Just like solving equations, but with attitude! Add 5 to both sides (2x > 8), then divide by 2 to get x > 4. The inequality sign stays put because we're dividing by a positive number. Remember: only flip the sign when dividing by negatives!

    This one's actually friendly enough to factor! Looking for two numbers that multiply to 4 and add to 5... that's 1 and 4. So we get (x + 1)(x + 4) = 0. Set each factor to zero: x = -1 and x = -4. Sometimes the quadratic formula is overkill – like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

  <div className="explanation">
    Time to factor like a boss! The numerator x² - 4 is a difference of squares: (x - 2)(x + 2). The denominator x² - 4x + 4 is a perfect square trinomial: (x - 2)². After canceling the common (x - 2) factor, we get (x + 2)/(x - 2). Remember: we're assuming x ≠ 2, because division by zero is mathematically illegal.

    Domain is basically "what values of x won't break this function?" For rational functions, the denominator can't be zero (division by zero is mathematically forbidden). Set x + 3 = 0, so x = -3 is our troublemaker. Domain: all real numbers except x = -3. Think of -3 as the function's kryptonite.

    The classic y = mx + b format! Here, m = 2 (the slope) and b = -3 (the y-intercept). The slope tells you how steep the line is, and the y-intercept is where it crosses the y-axis. Easy pattern recognition – no detective work required.
