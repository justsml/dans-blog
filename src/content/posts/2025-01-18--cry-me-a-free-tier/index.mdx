# Cry me a "free" tier

Remember when deploying infrastructure required a PhD in System Architecture, three forms in triplicate, and a blood sacrifice to the Unix gods? Now any intern with AWS credentials can accidentally spawn a bitcoin mining empire before lunch. Progress!

The cloud vendors, bless their infinitely scalable hearts, have made it so goddamn easy to greet a sudden flood of hundreds of millions of new customers! They're just trying to help you make money! Never mind if you write obscure articles for 14 people, stop thinking small, after all one of those 14 could be a billionaire!

They're definitely not evil. Oh no, in fact, they're just so *supportive* of your growth! Who else will selflessly shoulder any cost or burden, to ensure they can faithfully deliver such costs on to customers.

## The Free Tier Fallacy

Ah, the "free tier" - the cloud equivalent of the first hit being free. Sure, you can run that t2.micro instance for free... right up until you accidentally attach a 1TB SSD because "storage is cheap" and suddenly you're paying more monthly than your car payment.

The free tier is like those "free" puppies that end up costing $15,000 in vet bills. Except instead of chewing your shoes, these puppies spawn endless zombie processes and mine cryptocurrency in regions you didn't know existed.

## Unlimited? Limitless!

Here's a radical thought: what if we had... limits? *gasp*

I know, I know. In the hallowed halls of trillion-dollar tech companies, suggesting "limits" is like proposing any architecture that isn't Web Scale.
