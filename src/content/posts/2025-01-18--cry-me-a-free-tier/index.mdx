# Cry me a "free" tier

ATTENTION DEVELOPERS! üö®

Are you tired of predictable infrastructure costs? Bored with reasonable spending limits? Do you lie awake at night thinking "by the time I wake up, AWS could be tallying up my financial ruin"?

No?

Well, you're not alone.

This post from Reddit is all too common:

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" style="height:500px" data-embed-height="639"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1iv0ziv/i_just_hacked_for_60k_no_idea_what_to_do_and_no/">I just hacked for $60k‚Ä¶ no idea what to do and no AWS support</a><br /> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Sea6418/">u/Competitive_Sea6418</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/">aws</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

Since AWS introduced their pioneering "auto-scaling" concept to pricing countless engineers & hobbyists have experience the thrill of "unlimited" spending.

The cloud vendors‚Äìbless their _infinitely scalable hearts_‚Äìhave made it so goddamn easy to succeed. They're just trying to help you prepare for success! Never mind if your blog gets 14 visitors per month ‚Äì think big, cloud big! After all, what if Elon tweets (Xeets?) your latest post?!?

They're definitely not taking advantage of hobbyists, learners or cost conscious businesses, right?

Oh no, in fact, they're simply so very *supportive* of your growth! Who else will selflessly shoulder any cost, bear any burden? Denial of Service? Nice try, but thanks to the modern cloud, that's just another opportunity for growth! It's not an attack, it's a load test! ü§ó

## The Free Tier Fallacy

Ah, the "free tier" - the cloud equivalent of the first hit being free. Sure, you can run that t2.micro instance for free... right up until you accidentally attach a 1TB SSD because "storage is cheap" and suddenly you're paying more monthly than your car payment.

The free tier is like those "free" puppies that end up costing $15,000 in vet bills. Except instead of chewing your shoes, these puppies spawn lonely instances in regions you didn't know existed. Bad dog!

## Unlimited? Limitless!

Here's a radical thought: what if we had... limits? *gasp*

I know, I know. In the hallowed halls of trillion-dollar tech companies, suggesting "limits" is like suggesting "no more free kombucha". But hear me out: what if we had a way to say "I only want to spend $X per month"?

I know, it's crazy talk.

Well, the craziest thing about this issue is not that cloud companies operate in this way. It's that so many (seemingly real) people become <b>vociferous cloud zealots defending bad billing practices with even worse bad-faith arguments.</b>






## The Cloud Zealot's Migration Pattern

Like salmon returning to spawn or Twitter users to a bad take, Cloud Zealots have an uncanny ability to appear whenever someone suggests that maybe, just maybe, cloud providers could implement basic spending controls. Their migration pattern is as predictable as it is tiresome:

"No business wants their systems to have a kill switch!" they proclaim, apparently having never heard of circuit breakers, fuses, or literally any other critical system designed by sane people. Because clearly, the only two options are "unlimited spending" or "total destruction" - nuance died in the cloud, apparently.

"Only businesses should use the cloud!" they decree, presumably from their golden towers where every developer has an enterprise budget and no one ever learns new technologies on their own. I guess we should all just practice... offline?

My personal favorite: "It's not the cloud provider's job to make you do things correctly!" Ah yes, because other industries totally work this way. Imagine if banks said "It's not our job to prevent theft & fraud. We just provide the infrastructure!" Imagine being on the hook simply because someone tried to withdraw $1 million from your account. "Oh, you don't have a million? It's ok, you can simply pay us off for life."

<blockquote class="reddit-embed-bq" data-embed-height="240"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1cg7ce8/comment/l20c3yf/">Comment</a><br /> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/macok9/">u/macok9</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/1cg7ce8/how_an_empty_private_s3_bucket_can_make_your_bill/"></a><br /> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/">aws</a></blockquote><script async="" src="https://embed.reddit.com/widgets.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

And let's not forget the classic "A global real-time usage tracking system isn't feasible!" - spoken with a straight face about companies that can tell you how many milliseconds your function took to execute in data centers around the world, but somehow can't implement a reasonable spending cap.

Another bit of choice sentiment, "did you even RTFM?!" they screech, clutching their Well-Architected Framework pearls. Because apparently, the solution to "I don't want to accidentally spend $100k" is buried somewhere in 100,000 pages of terms of use & documentation, between "Best Practices for IPv6 in Lambda" and "CloudFront via Quantum Entanglement."

Here's a radical thought: If your cloud infrastructure can automatically scale up to handle a bajillion requests per second, maybe - just maybe - it could also automatically scale down when someone's stolen API key starts mining Ethereum in 47 regions simultaneously.

But what do I know? I'm just someone who thinks that companies moving to the cloud aren't actually trying to transcend economic reality. Call me old-fashioned, but I believe most businesses prefer their surprise bills to come from the office holiday party, not from a dev environment experiment.

## The Cloud's Infinite Loop

But wait ‚Äì because nothing says "enterprise grade" quite like defaulting to a "let 'er rip" configuration. Auto-scaling groups set to 0-1000 instances? Why not! Storage buckets configured for global replication from day one? You deserve it, tiger!

As one AWS engineer (who definitely doesn't get bonuses based on consumption) once told me: *"Why put guardrails around a lamborghini? If you wanted limits, you should've stuck with your on-premises servers."* üèéÔ∏èüí®

## A Cautionary Tale in Three Cloud Logs

Let's peer into the nightmare of some _actual production incidents_:

1. **The Endless Container Spiral**
Developer (me) does load tests on Kubernetes before deployment ‚Üí Forgets a few limits ‚Üí Gets an angry Monday email from the CTO, something about a $18,400 GCP bill over the weekend.

2. **The Bucket List**
For over 17 years AWS charged for **unauthenticated requests** ‚Üí Developer (not me) creates a private S3 bucket ‚Üí Overnight over 100 Million unauthorized requests rack up [$1,300 in charges.](https://medium.com/@maciej.pocwierz/how-an-empty-s3-bucket-can-make-your-aws-bill-explode-934a383cb8b1)

3. **The AI-Piggy Bank**  
"Let's add ChatGPT to our app!" ‚Üí Forgets to cap free trial users ‚Üí 80,000 API calls at $0.02/request ‚Üí Azure gleefully processes $1,600 in 14 minutes.

## How Not To Go Bankrupt (A Survival Guide)

The cloud providers may treat your wallet like an all-you-can-spend buffet, but here's how to avoid becoming their afternoon snack:

- **Billing Alarms Are Your Yelling Parents**  
Set up alerts at $1, $10, and "HOLY MOTHER OF SANTA CLAUS WHAT HAVE YOU DONE" thresholds. AWS will email you _after_ the damage is done, but it's better than nothing.

- **Terraform: The Shovel for Digging Graves**  
Automation is great! Just remember that **`terraform apply`** can bankrupt you as efficiently as it builds infra. Always pair with:

```bash
alias terrafuck='terraform destroy -auto-approve'
```

- **The 3 AM Rule**  
If your app doesn't need to survive a nuclear Holocaust, turn off the goddamn dev environments at night. Yes, even if you're "definitely gonna code later."

- **Credit Card Limits != Cloud Limits**  
Be careful using virtual cards with fixed limits. This is sometimes recommended, and is 100% terrible advice. When the cloud provider inevitably tries to charge $10,000, you‚Äôll enjoy the thrilling realization that **card limits don‚Äôt apply to committed contracts**. They‚Äôll still bill you whatever you owe,  terminate accounts, and send you to debt collectors.

## In Cloud We Trust (To Bleed Us Dry)

At the end of the day, we're all just temporarily deferred millionaires waiting for our apps to go viral. The cloud providers understand this capitalist fantasy better than anyone‚Äîthey‚Äôve turned ‚Äúscale‚Äù into a way of being.

So go forth, intrepid developer! Deploy that serverless microservice with recursive Lambda triggers! Just remember: somewhere in Seattle, an AWS exec is toasting to your "growth mindset" with a martini made from the tears of startups past. üç∏
