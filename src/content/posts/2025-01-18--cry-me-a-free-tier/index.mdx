# Cry me a "free" tier

Remember when deploying infrastructure required a PhD in System Architecture, and the blessing of three senior ops engineers? Those were the days.

<p class="inset">Now, thanks to the miracle of modern cloud platforms, any dingus with an AWS account can summon a $100,000 hosting bill without breaking a sweat.</p>

The cloud vendors, bless their infinitely scalable hearts, have made it so goddamn easy to greet a sudden flood of hundreds of millions of new customers! They're just trying to help you make money! Never mind, if you write obscure articles for 14 people, stop thinking small, after all one of those 14 could be a billionaire!

Stop thinking small, 


. They're not evil – oh no, they're just *supportive*.
So supportive, they will make sure 


 5,000% increase in price, but they're missing the 

## Unlimited Limitlessness

Here's a radical thought: what if we had... limits? *gasp*

I know, I know. In the hallowed halls of trillion-dollar tech companies, suggesting "limits" is like proposing any architecture that isn't Web Scale.

```
Dear Big Cloud,
My blog costs $5/month.
If it hits $500, something's wrong.

This isn't rocket science.
XOXO,
Your Frustrated Customer
```

## The Pay-As-You-Go Paradise

Fun fact: the cloud didn't invent pay-as-you-go pricing. That honor belongs to a long line of innovations including parking meters, coin-operated beds (yes, that was a thing), and those sultry '900' number operators who definitely weren't just there to talk about your day.

But unlike those simple mechanical predecessors, cloud pricing has evolved into something more akin to a time-share presentation where the salesperson has a PhD in distributed systems. They'll talk your ear off about investment and scalability while conveniently glossing over the fact that you'll be paying until the heat death of the universe you just simulated.

{/* ## The User Stories They Can't Solve

For all their AI prowess and engineering might, the FAANGs of the world still haven't cracked these basic user stories:

- "As a student, I'd like to learn cloud computing without risking bankruptcy."
- "As a CTO, I'd like to not have to explain to the board why it's challenging to prevent a 5,000% jump in our monthly cloud bill." */}

## The Non-Solution Solution

"But this is a complex engineering problem!" they cry, as if implementing spending limits is harder than building a globally distributed database that can survive nuclear war. Somehow, my local gas station figured out how to stop charging me after $50, but AWS can't figure out how to send me more than an email when I'm about to remortgage my house to pay my cloud bill.

## Conclusion

Look, I love the cloud. It's magnificent. Revolutionary. The fact that I can deploy a global application from my couch while wearing yesterday's underwear is nothing short of miraculous. But perhaps – and I'm just spitballing here – with great power should come great guardrails.

Until then, I'll be here, obsessively refreshing my billing dashboard, praying to the cloud gods that my terraform destroy actually worked this time. Because in the end, the cloud is less like a utility and more like a Vegas casino – the house always wins, and there's always one more sucker ready to bet their startup's future on unlimited scalability.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go check if I remembered to turn off that Kubernetes cluster I was "just testing."
