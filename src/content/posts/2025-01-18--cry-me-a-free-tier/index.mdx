{/* # Cry me a "free" tier */}

In a world where tech companies love to brand themselves as innovative disruptors, there's one shocking truth they'd prefer you ignore: major cloud platforms offer zero protection against infinite billing. Somehow they can limit Lambda concurrency to one or 100. Or disable your account 1 request over 100 Million .

## The Shocking Reality of Unchecked Spending

Imagine waking up to a $104,500 bill for a website that normally gets 200 daily visitors. Or €16,000 in charges from an API key you haven't used in years. These aren't hypothetical scenarios—they're real nightmares happening to real people right now. Some are corporate people.

One of my clients thought he was safe from over charges. He's a savvy silicon valley type after all, and wouldn't just give his main card numbers to any old cloud. He generated a temp credit card with a $3,000/month limit! Well, it turns out service providers still expect to be paid that $36,000 racked up over the weekend-- regardless of how many times his temp card gets declined.

Another one of my clients ran a 24hr load test, every 24 hours. For months. No one really looked into it because it was labeled "24hr temp," with many spot instances. It only cost $820K to run this cluster to nowhere, for no one. 

Naturally, management wanted guarantees: that no test or dev environment should ever cost over, say $5K/month. I thought this had to be implemented by now...

There's no way these companies--with all the mighty AI engineers in the world--haven't found a way to prevent runaway charges and infinite hidden fees. Surely?

They wouldn't dare to be so indifferent, especially to the needs of the small to medium size customer, right? Right? Fuck. Well, they surely wouldn't shill "free tiers" that easily incur fees. After all, this is the country where Red Bull paid $13 Million to settle claims they lied promising to "give you wings." In FTC v. Marriott International (2021) Marriott settled for $150 million over undisclosed resort fees. Oh right, Amazon could buy Marriott and Red Bull just to wash it down.
Hell yea, my wings are back! 

## Too Cool For Limits

Introducing `Infinite` fees! Now part of "free tier." Check and mate.

Cloud providers are about freedom, freeing you to think like a billionaire, without letting your bank account, and its size limit your dreams! Free yourself from spending limits! Alerts? For the poors, baby!

### Silly Kids, Dreams are for Clouds

Take u/liubanghoudai24's Netlify experience: 190TB of bandwidth in 4 days. Their "solution"? Offer a 95% discount—which still means a $5,000 bill for a DDoS attack they didn't prevent.

### Don't let this cloud drop below 50 MPH

## Jobs to be Done

"If you dance with unicorns, be ready for the uni horns." - my mother.

Even the largest cloud customers face getting hit with runaway charges, they too might like to set a hard limit on test accounts. Look I get it, the cloud companies are obviously reluctant to unleash their coveted AI Developers to solve this, after all it costs an arm and a robot leg to run them!


Next steps:

- **Set up billing alerts**. This is the most basic step, but it's also the most important. You can't control what you can't measure.
- **Set up spending limits**. This is a bit more advanced, but it's also a bit more important. You can't control what you can't limit.
- **Set up a budget**. This is the most advanced step, but it's also the most important. You can't control what you can't budget.
- Contact your local politician.
