# Cry me a "free" tier

## An Irreverent Guide to Navigating Cloud Vendor Cost Controls

Remember the days when deploying infrastructure required a PhD in System Architecture and the blessing of three senior ops engineers? That's so 2009. Now, thanks to cloud platforms, any dingus with a credit card can summon a $100,000 hosting bill faster than you can say "budget overrun."

Welcome to our handy guide on how to painstakingly implement cost controls in the cloud—or rather, how each vendor makes it an Olympic sport in tedium.

## Step 1: Understand the "Generosity" of the Free Tier

Cloud vendors, bless their infinitely scalable hearts, are oh-so-generous with their free tiers. They're thrilled to help you scale to millions of customers! Churn out that blog for an audience of 14 people, and aim big—one might be a billionaire! They're not evil—just *supportive*. So supportive, they'll ensure your bills soar by 5,000%, but hey, at least your dreams (and costs) are limitless.

## Step 2: Set Cost Limits (Theoretically)

Here's a radical thought: what if cloud spending had limits? *gasp* It seems tech giants find spending limits less appealing than not building that house on Mars, but for kicks, let's try:

```markdown
Dear Big Cloud,
My blog costs $5/month.
If it hits $500, something's wrong.

Need I say more?
XOXO,
Your Frustrated Customer
```

Now, attempt to *actually* enforce this. Enjoy navigating labyrinthine billing dashboards, followed by interpreting daily emails that rival philosophical essays in complexity.

## Step 3: The "Simple" Pay-As-You-Go Lie

You might think managing cloud costs is like pay-as-you-go parking meters. Reality check: cloud pricing is more akin to a high-stakes poker game with cost-control features buried like treasure islands. Prepare for a sales pitch worthy of a time-share presentation, while glossing over the fact you'll be paying until the end of days.

## User Stories Cloud Vendors Ignore

Despite all their AI wonder and engineering might, tech giants still can't solve basic user stories:

- "As a student, I'd like to learn cloud computing without risking bankruptcy."
- "As a CTO, I'd like to not have to explain to the board why it's challenging to prevent a 5,000% jump in our monthly cloud bill."

## Why Set Limits When You Can Just Cry?

"But this is a complex engineering challenge!" vendors cry—yet my local gas station stops charging after $50. While building a globally distributed database that can survive nuclear fallout, limiting spend apparently remains the unsolvable Gordian Knot of cloud computing.

## A Shamefully Funny Conclusion

In the end, I love the cloud. It's magnificent and revolutionary, allowing me to deploy globally while still sporting yesterday's sweatpants. But maybe—just spitballing here—we could couple power with, say, responsible guardrails?

Let me leave you with real horror stories from [Serverless Horrors](https://serverlesshorrors.com/):

- One startup faced a cloud bill rising to $10,000 overnight because a developer accidentally enabled logging on everything—oops.
- A developer learning architecture designs racked a $5,500 bill after leaving his VMs running during a week's vacation.

The truth? In cloud computing, the house always wins, making every startup their next jackpot. So, go ahead, keep that Kubernetes cluster running—just maybe not while you're "just testing."

Happy cloud computing—may your keys be debugged and your bills, surprisingly low!
