    What are the primary AWS S3 storage classes?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  AWS S3 offers multiple storage classes:
  - Standard: For frequently accessed data
  - Infrequent Access (IA): Lower cost for less frequent access
  - Glacier: Long-term, low-cost archival storage

  Each class offers different pricing and access characteristics, allowing cost optimization based on data usage patterns.

  <div className="question">
    What's the primary consideration when choosing a DynamoDB partition key?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  The partition key should distribute data evenly across partitions to:
  - Prevent "hot" partitions
  - Optimize read/write performance
  - Avoid throttling

  Bad partition keys (like sequential IDs) can cause uneven data distribution and performance bottlenecks.

  <div className="question">
    Which of these real services CANNOT ‚ùå perform **row-level column** queries?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  This one is a little tricky.
  
  1. Not many folks know S3 objects can be queried (w/ Athena.) Supports several formats, including CSV, JSON+LD, and Parquet.
  2. RDS, Aurora, and DynamoDB are traditional databases that support SQL-like queries.
  3. CloudWatch and CloudTrail are monitoring services, however they both support querying logs. Output logs in JSON to get granular column-level filtering.

  Graph Databases like Neptune and Neo4j would be pointless if you couldn't search their data using logical expressions. So, why is it the answer?
  
  In the world of Graph Databases, you're **not querying rows and columns**, you're querying **vertices and edges.** This hints at a fundamentally different way of thinking about data. Using a term like "row" instead of "vertex" in the wrong context _could_ reveal your lack of experience to an expert or interviewer. üòÖ

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  Multi-AZ deployment:
  - Provides automatic failover
  - Creates a synchronous standby replica
  - Increases database availability
  - Minimizes downtime during infrastructure failures

  It's different from read replicas, which are used for scaling read operations.

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  Optimal caching strategy:
  - Cache frequently accessed data
  - Prefer data that doesn't change often
  - Consider cache invalidation strategies
  - Monitor cache hit/miss rates

  Avoid caching:
  - Rapidly changing data
  - Rarely accessed information
  - Large, infrequently used datasets

    What's the recommended approach to S3 bucket permissions?
  </div>

  <slot name="explanation">
  <div className="explanation">
  In virtually ALL systems, embracing a "least privilege" design is a key way to harden & future proof. Trying to lock down an existing system is about as difficult as moving an entire office building to a new foundation.
  
  S3 buckets are no exception. To apply the principle of least privilege, start with no permissions and grant only the necessary access. Use IAM roles and policies to control access and regularly audit bucket permissions.
  
  Security best practices:
  - Apply least privilege principle
  - Start with no permissions
  - Grant only necessary access
  - Use IAM roles and policies
  - Regularly audit bucket permissions

  Avoid overly permissive settings that could expose sensitive data.

  On-Demand Capacity is best for:
  - Unpredictable workloads
  - Sporadic traffic
  - Applications with unknown access patterns
  - Avoiding over-provisioning

  Provisioned capacity is better for:
  - Predictable, consistent workloads
  - More control over performance
