## Money: Localization (L10n) and Internationalization (i18n)

They aren't just for dominating a game of Scrabble, _localization_ & _internationalization_ refer to the process of making a product **feel at home in a different country.**

<p class="breakout quote">Showing a currency in the wrong local format is a dead give-away: you've put in no effort.<br/>If you can't format a price, how could you handle shipping?</p>

Internationalization is a big topic, covering everything from text translation to date formatting. In this post we'll focus in on a particular subtopic, **formatting numbers and currency.**

Let's explore formatting between 3 Eurozone countries, USA and India:

- `€1,234,567.89` Ireland 🇮🇪
- `1.234.567,89 €` Germany 🇩🇪
- `1 234 567,89 €` France 🇫🇷
- `$1,234,567.89` USA 🇺🇸
- `₹12,34,567.89` India 🇮🇳

Chaos! Right? There's symbols, whitespace and punctuation flying all over! It's amazing how the EU can agree on anything! 😅

## Critical Concepts

Before we dive into solutions, what do we mean by "Numbers are Local"?

### Numbers are Local 🏘️

Every locale ([Country per ISO 3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes)) defines rules for formatting numbers.

Number formatting rules include:

- Decimal: comma, period.
- Thousands: comma, period, space.
- Currency symbol position & spacing.

### Currency is Global 🌎

A `currency` refers to a specific unit of money. (See [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes_(list_one)) for list.)

- Specifies a symbol: `$`, `€`, `£`, `¥`. (Often reused.)
- Always has a 3-letter code: `USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`.
- Can be used/exchanged in "any" country. In theory.
- Converting between currencies requires exchange rate data.
- Value doesn't change based on locale.

### When Locale Matters

Most ecommerce/payment REST APIs deal in `price` + `currencyCode`. Why no locales?

Locales are (typically) set at the OS/Device level, and browsers make it available via `navigator.language`. Since every one of your users could have a different locale, it only makes sense to format numbers and currency on the client side.

## A Solution

Ok, good news! Modern programming languages have built-in support for this. In JavaScript, we have the [`Intl`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl) class and `Intl.NumberFormat`!

Let's check out some code:

```javascript
const number = 1_234_567.89;

/**
 * Format a number in local currency.
 * @param {number} amount - The amount to format.
 * @param {string} currency - The 3-letter currency code.
 * @param {string} [locale] - The users locale string.
 */
const formatMoney = (amount, currency, locale = navigator.language) =>
  new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, { currency, style: 'currency' })
    .format(amount);

console.log('🇩🇪 ' + formatMoney(number, 'EUR', 'de-DE'));
console.log('🇮🇪 ' + formatMoney(number, 'EUR', 'ga-IE'));
console.log('🇫🇷 ' + formatMoney(number, 'EUR', 'fr-FR'));
```

If you need to do fancier things, like calculating taxes, applying discounts, or converting between currencies, you'll want to use a library like [dinero.js](https://v2.dinerojs.com/).

## Next Steps

Depending on your particular needs, you may want to explore related concepts:

- Best practices with user locale. Detect + allow overrides. (e.g. a country drop down.)
- Persisting whole integers (store cents, not dollars.)
- Money math. (e.g. applying a `20% off` coupon, calculating `subTotal + taxes`, etc.)
- Live exchange rates. (For retail purchases, forex/currency exchanges.)

{/* ## Recommendations

Some libraries can help with these tasks: 

**JavaScript / TypeScript**

- [dinero.js](https://v2.dinerojs.com/) supports money math, exchange rates, formatting, and parsing!

**Rust**

- [rusty_money](https://crates.io/crates/rusty_money) is my preferred Rust library.

**Go**

- [currency](https://github.com/bojanz/currency) is my current Golang choice.
