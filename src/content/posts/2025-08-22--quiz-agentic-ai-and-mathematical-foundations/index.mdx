  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The Bellman optimality equation states that the optimal value of a state equals the maximum over all actions of the expected immediate reward plus the discounted optimal value of the successor state: V*(s) = max_a Σ P(s'|s,a)[R(s,a,s') + γV*(s')]. This recursive relationship is fundamental to dynamic programming and reinforcement learning.

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) is a paradigm where language models interleave reasoning traces with action execution. This allows agents to dynamically reason about and interact with external environments, tools, and APIs while maintaining interpretable thought processes. It's fundamental to many modern AI agent implementations.

    What is the correct formula for Shannon entropy H(X) of a discrete random variable X?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Shannon entropy H(X) = -Σ p(x) log p(x) measures the expected amount of information contained in a random variable. It's maximized when all outcomes are equally likely and minimized when the distribution is deterministic. This concept is crucial for understanding information-theoretic approaches to agent learning and decision-making.

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    A belief state in a POMDP is a probability distribution b(s) over all possible world states s, representing the agent's uncertainty about the true state given its observation history. The belief state is updated using Bayes' theorem as new observations arrive: b'(s') ∝ Σ_s P(o|s',a)P(s'|s,a)b(s).

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Gradient descent with fixed step size converges to the global minimum when the objective function is convex and has Lipschitz continuous gradients (||∇f(x) - ∇f(y)|| ≤ L||x - y|| for some constant L). The step size must satisfy α < 2/L for convergence. This is crucial for understanding optimization in agent learning algorithms.

    A* finds optimal solutions when the heuristic h(n) is both admissible (never overestimates true cost: h(n) ≤ h*(n)) and consistent (satisfies triangle inequality: h(n) ≤ c(n,n') + h(n')). The algorithm uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n) to prioritize nodes, where g(n) is the actual cost from start to n.

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    KL divergence D_KL(P||Q) = Σ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x)) measures how much one probability distribution differs from another. It's non-negative, non-symmetric, and equals zero only when P = Q.

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The main challenge in MARL is non-stationarity: as each agent learns and changes its policy, the environment appears non-stationary to other agents. This violates the stationarity assumption of single-agent RL and requires techniques like centralized training with decentralized execution, or opponent modeling to achieve stable learning.

  <slot name='hints'>

    MCTS consists of: 1) Selection - traverse tree using UCB1 formula, 2) Expansion - add new node to tree, 3) Simulation - random playout to terminal state, 4) Backpropagation - update node values back to root. The UCB1 formula balances exploration/exploitation: UCB1 = w_i/n_i + c√(ln(N)/n_i).

    Variational inference approximates intractable posterior distributions p(z|x) with tractable variational distributions q(z). It minimizes KL(q(z)||p(z|x)) equivalently by maximizing the Evidence Lower BOund (ELBO): L = E_q[log p(x,z) - log q(z)]. This is fundamental to variational autoencoders and Bayesian neural networks in agent architectures.
