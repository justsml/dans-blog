Every few years, education discovers a new existential threat. Some technology emerges, and suddenly we're doomed to become drooling idiots without our electronic overlords. This pattern is so predictable you could set your Apple Watch by it—assuming it hasn't already destroyed your ability to tell time.

The current panic centers on AI, but before we hyperventilate, let's examine history's lessons. When CliffsNotes appeared in the 1940s, educators warned students would never read Shakespeare again. In the 1950s, comic books were supposedly creating a generation of juvenile delinquents. The 1980s saw calculators branded as "crutches that will hobble a generation." Each time, society adapted rather than collapsed.

Consider calculators: They didn't end mathematical thinking; they reshaped how we approach problem-solving. Students focused on higher-level concepts instead of rote memorization. The internet, once feared as attention span's nemesis, democratized knowledge and connected rural students to world-class resources.

GPS offers a particularly telling example. The doomsayers were technically correct—few people under 30 can read paper maps. But instead of destroying navigation skills, GPS transformed them. Today's digital natives can instantly navigate any city worldwide, optimize routes in real-time, and understand complex traffic patterns—capabilities that didn't exist in the paper map era.

AI has very real strengths and weaknesses. It can process vast amounts of information and generate human-like text with remarkable speed. But it lacks the emotional intelligence, creativity, and critical thinking that define human learning. The challenge isn't preventing its use but teaching students to use it effectively.

One thing that sparks visceral reactions is watching someone take a "shortcut" to what you had to work for. It's like comparing climbing a mountain to taking a helicopter to the summit. The helicopter is faster, but it feels less earned. This same tension appears in education: if students can generate essays with AI, are they cheating themselves out of learning, or are we clinging to outdated methods?

The sensible approach is treating AI as a tool requiring its own literacy. Educators, parents, and students must understand when AI enhances learning versus undermining development. Educators must redesign assessments for an AI-augmented world. After all, moral panic never graduates—it just keeps repeating the same grade.

We survived calculators, CliffsNotes, and possibly Facebook. We'll survive ChatGPT. In time, the kids will be fine. It's the adults who need to adapt.
