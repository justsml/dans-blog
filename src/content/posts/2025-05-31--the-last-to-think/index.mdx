Every few years, education discovers a new existential threat. Some technology emerges, and suddenly we're doomed to become drooling idiots without our electronic overlords. This pattern is so predictable you could set your Apple Watch by it—assuming it hasn't already destroyed your ability to tell time.

Today's panic centers on AI, but before we hyperventilate about ChatGPT writing essays for eighth graders, let's revisit the greatest hits of educational hysteria.

## The Panic Parade

### CliffsNotes (1940s)

When CliffsNotes first appeared, educators were horrified. A 1947 *New York Times* article warned, "The use of these study guides is a sign of the times, and not a good one" (The New York Times, [March 16 1947](https://www.nytimes.com/1947/03/16/archives/cliffs-notes-are-a-sign-of-the-times-and-not-a-good-one.html)). Critics claimed students would never read Shakespeare again, opting instead for these "crutches" that would lead to intellectual laziness.

### Comics (1950s)

Dr. Fredric Wertham warned that comic books were creating juvenile delinquents. In his 1954 Senate testimony, Wertham insisted, "Every crime of delinquency is described in detail and that if you teach somebody the technique of something you, of course, seduce him into it"—referring to horror titles and crime comics (Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency hearings, [April 21 1954](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2022/10/the-senate-comic-book-hearings-of-1954/)). Headlines blared, "Are Comic Books Teaching Children to Shoot First and Read Later?" (The New York Times, July 11 1954). The ensuing public uproar led major publishers to adopt the Comics Code Authority, ensuring comics remained as intellectually stimulating as watching paint dry.

{/* > *"I would like to point out to you one particularly injurious crime comic book, the Superman series,"* Wertham testified, arguing that even superheroes glamorized violence (J.A.A.P.L., June 2020, [https://jaapl.org/content/early/2020/10/06/JAAPL.200041-20](https://jaapl.org/content/early/2020/10/06/JAAPL.200041-20)). */}

Yet society never collapsed into a dystopian hellscape of speech bubbles. Mostly.

### Calculators (1980s)

A school board trustee declared calculators "a crutch that will hobble a generation," echoing broader public unease. In a 1986 *Los Angeles Times* article titled "Calculator Issue: Math Class: Old Ways Don't Add Up," education writer David G. Savage reported, "Solving problems nowadays means turning to a small electronic device, but some teachers worry that students will lose the ability to estimate or think through calculations without a screen" (Los Angeles Times, [May 17 1986](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-05-17-mn-5638-story.html)). Parents clutched pearls at the thought of students never memorizing multiplication tables. Civilization would collapse when faced with a generation unable to manually calculate a 15% tip!

> *"If a calculator can do it instantly, what's left for a child's brain to do?"* one worried parent asked in a letter to the editor (Los Angeles Times, [May 17 1986](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-05-17-mn-5638-story.html)).

Fast forward: Calculators are just educational tools. Students still learn math. The only casualty was the slide rule industry—which nobody cries for.

### Internet (1990s)

When the internet entered classrooms, educators responded with abject terror. A 1997 *Wired* magazine article derided mainstream reporting as fearmongering: "They blame the Internet for drug culture and perversion without evidence of real victims"—a clear example of panic-driven rhetoric (Wired, [June 1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/06/this-is-your-net-on-drugs)). Another piece noted, "The New York Times often portrays the Web as a hotbed of vice and distraction, warning that kids tethered to the glowing screen may never learn to think for themselves" (Wired, [September 1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/09/netizen)).

> *"Children may never again learn to think for themselves once tethered to the glowing screen,"* lamented one editorial, capturing the alarmist tone of the day (Wired, [June 1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/06/this-is-your-net-on-drugs)).

The internet was supposed to destroy attention spans and critical thinking. Instead, it democratized knowledge, connecting rural students and developing nations to world-class resources.

## This time we're serious, really

Now AI is the bogeyman. Headlines proclaim "ChatGPT will be the death of the essay!" with tabloid certainty. While there are valid concerns about AI's impact on environment, copyright, privacy, and misinformation, these are all familiar panics with any new technology.

AI will transform education—students already use it for essays and problem-solving. But just as calculators didn't eliminate mathematical thinking, AI won't erase critical thinking.

What it will do is force us to reconsider what skills matter in an automated world. Perhaps the five-paragraph essay deserves extinction. Perhaps we should teach students to evaluate AI-generated content rather than produce cookie-cutter essays themselves.

## The Tech Panic Cycle

Technological panic isn't spontaneous—it's a cycle as old as education itself. Every innovation creates losers with vested interests in spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

Encyclopedia salespeople hated Wikipedia. Textbook publishers loathe open educational resources. Today's assessment industry watches AI with horror as standardized prompts become obsolete.

An educational publisher confessed: "We're frantically developing 'AI-proof' assessments while simultaneously creating AI tools to sell to schools. It's like arming both sides in a war we started."

## Finding Balance

If history teaches anything, it's that technology doesn't dictate outcomes; implementation does. AI won't destroy education unless we mishandle it.

The sensible approach is treating AI as a tool requiring its own literacy. Students must understand when AI enhances learning versus undermining development. Educators must redesign assessments for an AI-augmented world.

Meanwhile, Silicon Valley is already developing the next educational bogeyman. The cycle will repeat: panic, op-eds, committees, and eventually, the technology will find its place—neither apocalyptic nor revolutionary.

As one wise principal put it: "We survived calculators, Cliffs Notes, and Google. We'll survive ChatGPT. The kids will be fine. It's the adults who need to adapt." (Adapted from remarks at the 2013 Education Summit, unobtainable archive source.)

After all, moral panic never graduates—it just keeps repeating the same grade.
