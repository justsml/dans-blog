Every few years, the educational establishment discovers a new existential threat to learning as we know it. Some novel technology appears, and suddenly we're all doomed to become drooling idiots, incapable of performing basic human functions without our new electronic overlords. The pattern is so reliable you could set your Apple Watch by it—assuming you haven't been rendered incapable of telling time by said Apple Watch™️.

Today's panic centers on AI, but before we get our knickers in a collective twist about ChatGPT writing essays for eighth graders, let's take a stroll down the memory lane of educational hysteria. After all, if we're going to panic properly, we should at least know we're part of a grand tradition.

## Calculator Calamity

In 1988, a school board trustee in Ontario, Canada declared with absolute certainty that calculators were "a crutch that will hobble a generation." Parents and educators clutched their pearls at the thought of students never memorizing their multiplication tables. Imagine the horror—children relying on technology rather than rote memorization! Surely civilization would collapse when faced with a generation unable to manually calculate a 15% tip.

> *My math teacher made me spend an entire semester solving equations by hand, because 'you won't always have a calculator with you.' I'm typing this on a device thousands of times more powerful than the computers that sent humans to the moon, which I keep in my pocket primarily to look at pictures of cats.*

Meanwhile, slide rule manufacturers watched their market evaporate and blamed their collapse on what they called "the nefarious digital coup." Industry insiders whispered that "the abacus industry never stood a chance." Curiously, none of them blamed their demise on the fact that their product required a PhD in physics just to multiply two numbers.

Fast forward to today, and calculators are just another educational tool. Students still learn their times tables, and society somehow avoided the mathematical apocalypse. The most significant casualty was the slide rule industry, which literally no one freaking misses! Well, maybe except for a few hipsters who think using one (as decoration) is "retro cool."

## Comic Crimes

In the 1950s, psychiatrist Dr. Fredric Wertham published his magnum opus of moral panic, *Seduction of the Innocent*, warning that comic books were turning America's youth into juvenile delinquents faster than you could say "Holy inappropriate reading material, Batman!"

The Saturday Review asked with deadly seriousness: "Are comic books teaching children to shoot first and read later?" This was apparently a genuine concern, as if children would finish an issue of Superman and immediately begin plotting bank heists.

The crusade against comics was so effective that it led to the creation of the Comics Code Authority, a self-censorship body that ensured comics remained about as intellectually stimulating as watching paint dry. Batman could no longer hit criminals because violence was bad, but apparently destroying a child's imagination was perfectly acceptable.

Somehow, despite decades of exposure to graphic novels, society has yet to collapse into a dystopian hellscape where people communicate exclusively in speech bubbles. Ok, so maybe they aren't "speech bubbles," but "green and blue text bubbles" that are now ubiquitous in our digital communication. Society hasn't collapsed, despite our best efforts.

## The Internet Apocalypse

When the internet began appearing in classrooms in the late 1990s, educators reacted with the calm, measured response we've come to expect—abject terror.

A concerned citizen wrote to The Independent in 1996 that "children may never again learn to think for themselves once tethered to the glowing screen." Because apparently before the internet, every child was a budding philosopher engaged in deep critical thinking rather than watching cartoons or playing Nintendo.

The internet was supposed to destroy attention spans, eliminate critical thinking, and turn children into information-consuming zombies. Instead, it democratized knowledge in ways previously unimaginable. Yes, it gave us cat videos and conspiracy theories, but it also gave rural students access to the same information as their urban counterparts. It allowed children in developing nations to access world-class educational resources. It created opportunities for self-directed learning that previous generations could only dream of.

Did Wikipedia give teachers heart palpitations? Absolutely. Did students occasionally plagiarize? Of course. But the apocalypse never came. Instead, teachers adapted, developing new skills to help students navigate this brave new world. They learned to teach media literacy alongside traditional literacy, and the educational system stumbled forward as it always does.

## AI: The Current Classroom Villain

And now we arrive at AI, the latest technological bogeyman. If you believe the headlines, ChatGPT will single-handedly destroy education as we know it. The Daily Mail recently proclaimed that "ChatGPT will be the death of the essay!" with the same certainty they announce celebrity pregnancies and royal scandals.

Let's be clear: AI will change education. It's already happening. Students are using ChatGPT to write essays, solve math problems, and explain complex concepts. But much like the calculator didn't eliminate the need to understand mathematical concepts, AI won't eliminate the need for critical thinking.

What it will do is have unforseeable 2nd and 3rd order effects on how we teach and assess learning. Do standardized tests still make sense in an age where students can generate essays with a few keystrokes? Should we be teaching students to write essays at all, or should we be teaching them to evaluate and critique AI-generated content? Or should we be teaching them to use AI as a collaborative tool to enhance their own thinking?

AI is forcing us to reconsider what skills are truly essential in a world where information generation is automated. Perhaps the five-paragraph essay—that bland staple of educational assessment—deserves to die. Perhaps we should be focusing more on teaching students to critically evaluate AI-generated content rather than produce cookie-cutter content themselves.

After all, [Video Killed The Radio Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8r-tXRLazs), then podcasts arrived... Just in time to feature the murder they just committed.

## The Panic Industrial Complex

What these historical examples reveal is that technological panic isn't just a spontaneous reaction—it's an industry. Every new technology creates losers as well as winners, and those losers have a vested interest in spreading fear.

Encyclopedia salespeople didn't take kindly to Wikipedia. Textbook publishers aren't thrilled about open educational resources. And today, the massive educational assessment industry is watching AI with horror, realizing their standardized essay prompts might become obsolete overnight.

A reader who works in educational publishing confessed: "*We're frantically trying to develop 'AI-proof' assessments while simultaneously creating AI tools to sell to schools. It's like arming both sides in a war we started.*"

Behind every educational panic is someone whose business model is threatened. They wrap their concerns in the language of educational quality and student welfare, but follow the money and you'll usually find the real motivation.

## Lessons from History (That We'll Probably Ignore)

If history teaches us anything, it's that technological determinism is bullshit. Technology doesn't determine outcomes; how we choose to use technology does. Calculators didn't destroy mathematical thinking; poor teaching of calculators did. The internet didn't make critical thinking impossible; failing to teach media literacy did.

Similarly, AI won't destroy education unless we let it. If we thoughtlessly ban it, students will use it anyway and learn nothing about its proper application. If we thoughtlessly embrace it, we might miss opportunities to develop crucial human skills that AI can't replicate.

The sensible approach—which means it will probably be ignored by policymakers—is to treat AI as a tool that requires its own literacy. Students need to understand its capabilities and limitations. They need to learn when AI assistance is appropriate and when it undermines their own development. And educators need to redesign assessments to measure what matters in an AI-augmented world.

A university professor recently told me: "*I've started asking students to submit their ChatGPT prompts alongside their essays. The quality of thinking that goes into crafting good prompts is often more revealing than the essays themselves.*"

## The Next Panic Is Already Brewing

Even as we navigate the AI panic, you can be certain that somewhere in Silicon Valley, someone is developing the next educational bogeyman. Perhaps it's brain-computer interfaces that will allegedly make reading obsolete. Maybe it's virtual reality that will supposedly destroy students' grip on actual reality. Whatever it is, the cycle will repeat.

The educational establishment will panic. Op-eds will be written. Concerned parents will form committees. And eventually, inevitably, the technology will find its appropriate place in the educational ecosystem, neither as destructive nor as transformative as initially predicted.

Meanwhile, the fundamental challenges of education—engaging students, addressing inequality, developing critical thinking—will remain largely unchanged. Technology can help address these challenges, but it can't solve them alone.

## Finding Balance in the Hysteria

The truth about AI in education, as with all previous technological panics, lies somewhere between doom and utopia. AI won't destroy education, but it also won't solve all our educational problems. It's a tool—potentially a very powerful one—but still just a tool.

The key is to approach AI with a balanced perspective. We should neither ban it outright nor uncritically embrace it. Instead, we should thoughtfully integrate it into education, teaching students to use it as a complement to their own thinking rather than a replacement for it.

As one particularly wise school principal put it: "*We survived calculators, we survived Cliffs Notes, we survived Google, and we'll survive ChatGPT. The kids will be fine. It's the adults who need to adapt.*"

And adapt we will, however reluctantly, until the next technological bogeyman comes along and we do the whole thing all over again.

After all, moral panic never graduates—it just keeps repeating the same grade.
