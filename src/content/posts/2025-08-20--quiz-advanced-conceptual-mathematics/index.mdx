    Which set of properties correctly defines a group in abstract algebra?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    A group is a set G equipped with a binary operation that satisfies four fundamental axioms: **Closure** (the result of the operation on any two elements in G is also in G), **Associativity**, the existence of an **Identity Element**, and the existence of an **Inverse Element** for each element in G. Commutativity is required for a special type of group called an Abelian group, but not for all groups.

    Which of the following is a field?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    A field is a special type of commutative ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. The set of Rational Numbers (ℚ) forms a field because for any non-zero rational p/q, its inverse q/p is also a rational number. The Integers (ℤ) form a ring but not a field because most integers (like 2) do not have a multiplicative inverse that is also an integer (1/2 is not an integer).

    What is the formal epsilon-delta (ε-N) definition for the limit L of a sequence a_n?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The correct definition captures the essence of convergence rigorously. It states that for any arbitrarily small positive distance ε, you can find a point in the sequence (N) after which all subsequent terms (n > N) are within that distance of the limit L. This formalizes the idea of "getting arbitrarily close" to the limit.

    The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem is a fundamental result in real analysis. What does it guarantee?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    This theorem connects the concepts of boundedness and convergence. It guarantees that if you have an infinite sequence of points confined to a finite region (bounded), you are guaranteed to find a subsequence of points that "piles up" and converges to some limit point within that region. It's a cornerstone for proving many other results in analysis.

    What is the defining characteristic of an eigenvector of a linear transformation T?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    An eigenvector of a transformation T is a special non-zero vector v such that T(v) = λv, where λ is a scalar known as the eigenvalue. This means the transformation T does not change the direction of v; it only stretches or shrinks it. Eigenvectors represent the "axes" along which the transformation acts simply.

    The Rank-Nullity Theorem states that for a linear map T: V → W, the rank(T) + nullity(T) is equal to what?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The theorem states that rank(T) + nullity(T) = dim(V), where V is the domain. The rank is the dimension of the image (the output space), and the nullity is the dimension of the kernel (the set of vectors mapped to zero). The theorem provides a fundamental relationship between the dimensions of the spaces associated with a linear transformation, essentially saying that the dimension of the input is split between the dimension of the output and the dimension of what gets "crushed" to zero.

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p). This theorem is fundamental in number theory and has important implications for fields such as cryptography.
