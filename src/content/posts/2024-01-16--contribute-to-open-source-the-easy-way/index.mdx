### The Reality

We've all heard how beneficial it is to **_`contribute`_** to Open Source. But, it's not always easy to get started.

> Over my career, I've written many PR's for dozens of 10,000-Star repositories. My modest contributions have landed in Node.js, Docker, Lodash, Bluebird, Gatsby, Rancher, Angular, React Router, Minio, MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) and many more.

I'm going to share my secret to easy contributions, but first we need to briefly discuss the problems with the conventional advice.

### This is (Not) The Way

Why is it difficult to **_`contribute`_** to Open Source?

The most common advice actually falls somewhere between useless & terrible: Find a `GFI` issue (`Good First Issue` label) and solve it. Or, contribute to a project out of sheer love.

It's all well-intentioned, however in practice `GFI` labels are highly subjective, and often entail a surprising amount of work.

What if I told you the best place to look is the **solutions you've already found?**

### A Better Way

✅ Scan your project dependency file(s). Which libraries spark rage? What led to a missed deadline? How did you overcome it?

💪 By starting with something you already solved, there's **no need to worry if you can.** You're already **fluent; and familiar** with the context!

Since **you already solved the thing, most of the work is done.** Next, you need figure out how to **help others avoid your struggle altogether.**

Maybe a Tweet or Stack Overflow answer will do, but if you want to make a **lasting impact, _`contribute`_ to the project itself.**

### The Brainstorm

Preferably while the experience is somewhat fresh, contemplate how your _dumb dumb_ brain got so lost in the first place.

What did you try **first?** And why? What did you assume? Or misunderstand?

💪 You don't need to come up with a perfect solution, often simple updates to the readme or documentation can save others countless hours of struggle.

- An outdated README? Missing or bad examples? Omitted setup steps? _Simple fix, include any missing info!_
- Did the API documentation not show up in your Google results. _Adjust or translate overly technical language._
- Perhaps it's a technical oversight, and the docs site is missing necessary `<meta/>` tags. _Fix it if you know how, or write a ticket with your findings._
- If it's a skill issue... Work on those skillz!

These types of issues are easy for maintainers to miss! And can have surprisingly big impact on the project & its users.

Next time you conquer some challenge, _don't rebase away your deperate hacks!_ **Instead reflect on your struggle & share your solution publicly!**

### Fine, Fine Print

Always follow project guidelines, and never be an asshole. ✨

It's all public. So, be gracious, great, and grateful.

If you need any more convincing: `contribute` for the learning! New processes, languages, frameworks, automation!

{/* > Perhaps even more importantly, you can **quickly advance your communication skills!** The ability to advocate for your ideas can change your life! */}
