## You may not need Axios

> This **is not an attack** on [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios). <br />
> Rather, it's **advocacy for the `fetch` API which has become quite capable.** 🦄

When starting this article (late 2018, updated 2022) I assumed I'd end with a table of mixed check boxes. Surely there are special _Use Cases_ which justified [`axios`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), [`request`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request), [`r2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/r2), [`superagent`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent), [`got`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/got), etc.

Well, as it turns out, **I overestimated the need for 3rd party http libraries.**

Despite using `fetch` for several years (including for non-trivial tasks: file uploads & error/retry support) I still had misconceptions of `fetch`'s abilities and limits.

Well, let's check out what `fetch` can do...

#### Get JSON from a URL

<Gist path='justsml/de941bd61cc86e30beedbb8a3a646f81'></Gist>

#### Custom headers

<Gist path='justsml/fca7cd72ec1ebc07d994eac13a665ddf' />

#### HTTP Error Handling

<Gist path='justsml/81919a72897ebc503c6b34a556a9bde2' />

#### CORS example

CORS is primarily checked at the server - so make sure your configuration is correct on the server-side.

The `credentials` option controls if your cookies are automatically included.

<Gist path='justsml/3ddd9ed8705f48cdf45d313d1e57aa2a' />

#### Posting JSON

<Gist path='justsml/13915347d6c8413c73f4bd7240c68e51' />

#### Posting an HTML `<form>`

<Gist path='justsml/ef2e356bec0ef7c6e528d84a5f75ba7e' />

#### Form encoded data

To post data with a Content-Type of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` we will use `URLSearchParams` to encode the data like a query string.

For example, `new URLSearchParams({a: 1, b: 2})` yields `a=1&b=2`.

<Gist path='justsml/716c4534ef4afb22f65d4fc4367c7136' />

#### Uploading a file

<Gist path='justsml/301f22aa37df565ba3051bd5f95b4df1' />


#### Uploading multiple files

Setup a file upload element with the `multiple` attribute:

<Gist path='justsml/37836357041d8ca4d1b32e12638cb0ba' />

Then use with something like:

<Gist path='justsml/d17f50c36a5ddb70f584c0aa6de94237' />

#### Timeouts

Here's a generic Promise timeout, using the "Partial Application" pattern. It'll work with any Promise interface. Don't do too much work in the supplied promise chain, it will keep running - and any failures have a way of creating long term memory leaks.

<Gist path='justsml/f93b2ef6457b3e52eb995831b67cab85' />

And a more complex example, featuring a tracking flag `__timeout` so you can **intercept any costly work.**

<Gist path='justsml/5e492db8997a4f7e22e61b7486cbf273' />

#### Download Progress Helper

Upload Progress is currently a bit buggy outside of Chrome.

The Progress Handler [technique shown below avoids wrapping](#source-progress-helper) the `fetch` call in a closure. 👍

`progressHelper` has the following interface (source available below)

<Gist path='justsml/db5ccc55ffb93c75e04e014d1f553cfb' />

Let's look at a usage example:

<Gist path='justsml/9bec219590ff50688972c1caff67c14b' />

A reusable image downloader might look like `getBlob()`:

<Gist path='justsml/bef2dd7e630eb7642beb3e2be29489b2' />

By the way, a `Blob` is a Binary Large Object.

It's important to choose ONE of the 2 usage patterns below (they are functionally equivalent):

<Gist path='justsml/6ad9e37a96ad1f3a75ca509038510a5b' />

My preference is `Option #1`. However, your scope design may force you to use `Option #2`.

Finally, here's the last part of this recipe, our `progressHelper`:

#### Recursive Retry Helper

#### Handling HTTP Redirects

### Compatibility

As of 2022, the `fetch` API is [widely supported](https://caniuse.com/#feat=fetch) in all modern browsers and in more recent versions of NodeJS v18+.

If you must support IE you can [polyfill fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch#browser-support) with the `github/fetch` package (maintained by an awesome team at GitHub). It's possible to go as far back as [IE8](https://github.com/camsong/fetch-ie8) - _Your mileage may vary_.

Earlier NodeJS can take advantage of the the `fetch` API with the [`node-fetch`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch) package:

```sh
npm install node-fetch
```

_After polyfill+node-fetch: 99.99% compatible_ ✅
