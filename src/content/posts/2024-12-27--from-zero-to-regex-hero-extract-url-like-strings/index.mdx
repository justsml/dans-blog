Extracting URL-like strings from raw text can feel like a never-ending game of whack-a-mole: punctuation, parenthetical wrappers, and ambiguous formatting all conspire to break your best-laid regular expressions. In this post, we'll tackle the problem head-on with a flexible, two-step approach. Our goal is to **vacuum up** suspicious URL-ish text first, and then handle validation in a subsequent pipeline.

*(Original inspiration and discussion can be found here: [StackOverflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34669019/369727))*

TL;DR: Check out [a live demo of the regex](https://regex101.com/r/jO8bC4/62) in action.

## 1. Overview: Two Steps to URL Extraction

1. **Hoover Up Everything**
   Cast a wide net to grab all strings that *could* be URLs. This is where our "intimidating" regex flexes its muscles.

2. **Validate**
   Once you've captured these candidates, you can pass them through a rigorous check (DNS resolution, comparison against known domains, etc.) to weed out duds. That part will be left for the pipeline in step two.

---

## 2. The "Intimidating" Regex

Below is a one-line regex designed to catch a variety of protocols, domains, paths, and optional query/fragment sections:

```regex frame="code" title="URL-like String Extractor"
/([a-z0-9-]+\:\/+)([^\/\s]+)([a-z0-9\-@\^=%&;\/~+]*)[\?]?([^ \#\r\n]*)#?([^ \#\r\n]*)/
```

### How It Works, Step-by-Step

```text
1) Capture protocol ([a-z0-9-]+://+)
2) Capture domain/host ([^/\s]+)
4) Optionally capture query ([\?]?([^ \#\r\n]*))
5) Optionally capture fragment (#?([^ \#\r\n]*))
```

- **Group 1** `([a-z0-9-]+\:\/+)`
  Looks for the protocol (e.g., `http://`, `https://`, `ftp://`) by matching `[a-z0-9-]+:` followed by `//+`.

- **Group 2** `([^\/\s]+)`
  Captures the immediate domain or authority part (e.g., `example.com`, `localhost:8080`) until the next slash or whitespace.

- **Group 3** `([a-z0-9\-@\^=%&;\/~\+]*)`
  Matches path or parameter characters, allowing letters, numbers, common URL-safe symbols—enough to catch all sorts of oddities.

- **`[\?]?([^ \#\r\n]*)`**
  Optionally looks for a `?` and then captures whatever might represent a query string.

- **`#?([^ \#\r\n]*)`**
  Optionally captures any fragment identifier introduced by `#`.

This pattern is **NOT meant to be a perfect RFC-compliant** solution—it's deliberately broad to sweep up all plausible URL-like strings. Once captured, you can sort out the real URLs from the duds in the next step.

## 3. Example Code Snippet

Here's a short JavaScript example that uses this regex to capture URL-like strings from a sample input:

```js frame="code" title="js-example.js"
const text = `
Check this out: https://example.com/path?query=123#section
And also (ftp://files.server.org/index).
Plus a weird one: custom-scheme://host/param;weird^stuff
`;

const urlRegex = /([a-z0-9-]+\:\/+)([^\/\s]+)([a-z0-9\-@\^=%&;\/~\+]*)[\?]?([^ \#\r\n]*)#?([^ \#\r\n]*)/gi;

// Collect matches
const matches = [...text.matchAll(urlRegex)].map(match => match[0]);
console.log(matches);
```

Result (depending on your input):

```json
[
  "https://example.com/path?query=123#section",
  "ftp://files.server.org/index",
  "custom-scheme://host/param;weird^stuff"
]
```


## Next Steps

Depending on your use case, you might need to refine this regex or add more validation & post-processing steps.

### Different Projects, Different Needs

Different projects have different needs & security concerns:

1. **Web Scraping**
  You might need to validate URLs to ensure they're reachable or to filter out known malicious domains.
2. **Data Processing**
  If you're extracting URLs from user-generated content, you might want to ensure they're safe to visit.
3. **Data Analysis**
  If you're analyzing URLs for research or marketing purposes, you might need to filter out duplicates or irrelevant links.
4. **User-facing Chat**
  If you're building a chat app, you might want to automatically hyperlink URLs for users.

### Post-Processing & Validation

Once you've gathered everything that looks remotely like a URL, you can run them through more rigorous checks, as needed:

- **DNS Lookup**
  Verify the domain actually resolves.
- **Similarity Scoring**
  Compare new links against existing ones to detect duplicates or very close variants.
- **Custom Rules**
  Restrict TLDs, reject known malicious patterns, limit length, or anything else needed for your use case.

## Final Thoughts

- **Keep it simple for extraction;** make your life easier by casting a wide net, then refine afterward.
- **Regex is powerful but not omnipotent.** Don't expect it to be a perfect judge of URL correctness.
- **Iterate and test.** As you encounter new real-world texts, refine your regex or your validation pipeline to address emergent edge cases.

By following these steps, you can quickly and effectively extract URL-like strings from raw text, setting the stage for further processing and validation.
