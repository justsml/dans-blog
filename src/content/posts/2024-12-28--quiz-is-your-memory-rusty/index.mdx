      What happens when you run this code? Try to predict the output or error:
      ```rust
      fn main() {
          let philosopher = String::from("Zeno of Citium");
          let greeting = philosopher;  // What happens here?

          println!("Hello, {}!", philosopher);
      }
      ```
    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code fails to compile because of Rust's ownership rules. When we assign `philosopher` to `greeting`, the ownership of the String is moved to `greeting`. After this move, `philosopher` is no longer valid to use.

      Here are three ways to fix this:

      1. Clone the string (creates a new copy):
      ```rust
      let greeting = philosopher.clone();
      ```

      2. Use a reference (borrows the value):
      ```rust
      let greeting = &philosopher;
      ```

      3. Use a string slice (borrows part of the string):
      ```rust
      let greeting = &philosopher[..];
      ```

      Each solution has different use cases and performance implications. Cloning is more expensive but gives you ownership, while references are cheaper but have lifetime constraints.

      What happens when you run this code? Think about ownership transfer:
      ```rust
      fn take_ownership(text: String) {  // What happens to ownership here?
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
      }

      fn main() {

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      The code fails to compile because `wisdom` is moved into `take_ownership` and can't be used afterward.

      Here are three ways to fix this issue:

      1. Pass by reference (borrow the value):
      ```rust
      fn borrow_it(text: &String) {
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
      }
      borrow_it(&wisdom);  // Now wisdom can be used after
      ```

      2. Clone the value (create a new copy):
      ```rust
      take_ownership(wisdom.clone());  // Original wisdom remains valid
      ```

      3. Return ownership from the function:
      ```rust
      fn take_and_return(text: String) -> String {
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
          text  // Return ownership back
      }
      let wisdom = take_and_return(wisdom);  // Reassign returned ownership
      ```

      Each approach has different use cases:
      - References: Most efficient, but need lifetime management
      - Cloning: Simple but potentially expensive
      - Returning ownership: Useful for transforming values

      Best practice: Use references unless you need ownership transfer.

    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code violates Rust's fundamental borrowing rules:
      - Only ONE mutable reference to a value at a time
      - OR any number of immutable references
      - References cannot outlive their referent

      Here's how to fix the code:

      1. Use sequential scoping:
      ```rust
      let mut wisdom = String::from("He who laughs at");
      {
          let ref1 = &mut wisdom;
          ref1.push_str(" himself never runs");
      }  // ref1 goes out of scope
      let ref2 = &mut wisdom;  // Now this is valid
      ref2.push_str(" out of things to laugh at.");
      ```

      2. Or modify the string in a single borrow:
      ```rust
      let mut wisdom = String::from("He who laughs at");
      let ref1 = &mut wisdom;
      ref1.push_str(" himself never runs out of things to laugh at.");
      ```

      These rules prevent data races at compile time, making Rust thread-safe by default.

      Common pitfall: Trying to use multiple mutable references to avoid cloning or
      to modify different parts of the same value simultaneously.

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code compiles successfully thanks to Rust's lifetime elision rules. 
      These rules allow the compiler to automatically infer lifetimes in common patterns.

      The three lifetime elision rules are:
      1. Each parameter gets its own lifetime parameter
      2. If there's exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters
      3. If there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is &self or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all output lifetime parameters

      This function is equivalent to:
      ```rust
      fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
          // ... same implementation
      }
      ```

      Common patterns where elision works:
      ```rust
      // These don't need explicit lifetimes
      fn get_str(s: &str) -> &str { s }
      fn get_first(s: &str) -> &str { &s[0..1] }

      // These would need explicit lifetimes
      fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
          if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
      }
      ```

      Best practice: Let elision work for you when possible, but understand when explicit lifetimes are needed.

      What's wrong with this recursive type definition?

                      CatList::Nil)));
      }
      ```
    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code fails because the compiler can't determine the size of `CatList` at compile time. The recursive nature of the type means it could be infinitely large!

      Here's how to fix it using `Box<T>`:
      ```rust
      #[derive(Debug)]
      enum CatList {
          Cons(i32, Box<CatList>),  // Box provides a fixed-size pointer
          Nil,
      }

      fn main() {
          let catlist = CatList::Cons(1,
              Box::new(CatList::Cons(2,
                  Box::new(CatList::Cons(3,
                      Box::new(CatList::Nil))))));
      }
      ```

      Why `Box<T>` works:
      1. Box provides a fixed-size pointer (usually 8 bytes on 64-bit systems)
      2. The actual data is stored on the heap
      3. The compiler now knows exactly how much space to allocate

      Common use cases for `Box<T>`:
      - Recursive data structures (linked lists, trees)
      - Large data you want to ensure is heap-allocated
      - Trait objects when you need dynamic dispatch

      Best practice: Use `Box<T>` when you need:
      - Recursive types
      - To ensure heap allocation
      - To move large data without copying

              Rc::strong_count(&text)
          );
      }
      ```
    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      Let's break down how Rc works:

      1. Initial creation with `Rc::new()`: count = 1
      2. First clone for `marcus`: count = 2
      3. Second clone for `aurelius`: count = 3

      Important Rc characteristics:
      ```rust
      use std::rc::Rc;
      
      fn demonstrate_rc() {
          let original = Rc::new(String::from("Shared"));
          println!("Count after creation: {}", Rc::strong_count(&original)); // 1
          
          {
              let copy = Rc::clone(&original);
              println!("Count inside scope: {}", Rc::strong_count(&original)); // 2
          } // copy is dropped here
          
          println!("Count after scope: {}", Rc::strong_count(&original)); // 1
      }
      ```

      Key points:
      - Rc::clone() is cheap - it only increments a counter
      - Rc is for single-threaded scenarios only
      - When the last reference is dropped, the data is cleaned up
      - Use Weak references to prevent reference cycles

      Best practices:
      - Use Rc when you need shared ownership
      - Consider Arc for thread-safe scenarios
      - Avoid creating reference cycles

      This code fails because the compiler can't determine the relationship between the input and output lifetimes. Here's why and how to fix it:

      ```rust
      // Correct version with explicit lifetime annotation
      fn longest<'a>(text1: &'a str, text2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
          if text1.len() > text2.len() {

      Why lifetimes are needed here:
      1. Multiple input references could have different lifetimes
      2. The return value must live as long as both inputs
      3. The compiler needs to verify these relationships

      Common patterns:
      ```rust
      // Single input reference - elision works
      fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str { /* ... */ }

      // Multiple references, same lifetime needed
      fn compare_str<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str { /* ... */ }

      // Different lifetimes possible
      fn combine<'a, 'b>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str) -> String { /* ... */ }
      ```

      Best practices:
      1. Let lifetime elision work when possible
      2. Use explicit lifetimes when relationships need to be clear
      3. Consider returning owned types to avoid lifetime complexity
      4. Document complex lifetime relationships

      RefCell provides interior mutability but still enforces Rust's borrowing rules at runtime:

      ```rust
      use std::cell::RefCell;

      fn demonstrate_refcell() {
          let data = RefCell::new(42);
          
          // Correct way to use RefCell
          {
              let mut first = data.borrow_mut();
              *first += 1;
          } // first is dropped here
          
          // Now we can borrow again
          let second = data.borrow_mut();
          
          // Or multiple immutable borrows
          let read1 = data.borrow();
          let read2 = data.borrow(); // This is OK
      }
      ```

      Key concepts:
      1. RefCell moves borrowing checks to runtime
      2. Can cause panics if rules are violated
      3. Useful for interior mutability pattern

      Common use cases:
      - Mock objects in tests
      - Implementing self-referential structures
      - When you need to mutate data behind a shared reference
      
      Best practices:
      1. Prefer compile-time borrowing when possible
      2. Keep RefCell borrows in narrow scopes
      3. Consider using drop() to explicitly end borrows
      4. Use RefCell when you need interior mutability

      Cell and RefCell serve different purposes for interior mutability:

      ```rust
      use std::cell::{Cell, RefCell};

      // Cell for Copy types
      struct Counter {
          count: Cell<i32>,

         - No borrowing API
         - Always copies or moves values
      
      2. RefCell:
         - Works with any type
         - Has borrowing API
         - Runtime borrow checking

      Best practices:
      1. Use Cell for simple Copy types (numbers, bool, etc.)
      2. Use RefCell when you need to borrow the contents
      3. Keep mutations through Cell/RefCell minimal

      When should you use Rc (Reference Counting) in Rust?

      Consider this example:
      ```rust

      struct SharedConfig {
          name: String,
          value: i32,

      fn main() {

          let config2 = Rc::clone(&config);
          // Both config and config2 share ownership

  <slot name='explanation'>

      Rc (Reference Counting) is designed for single-threaded scenarios where you need shared ownership.

      Common use cases:
      ```rust
      use std::rc::Rc;
      use std::cell::RefCell;

      // Shared ownership in data structures
      struct Node {
          next: Option<Rc<Node>>,
          value: i32,
      }

      // Combining with interior mutability
      struct SharedState {
          data: Rc<RefCell<Vec<String>>>,
      }

      // Multiple owners of same data
      let original = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
      let clone1 = Rc::clone(&original);
      let clone2 = Rc::clone(&original);
      ```

      Key points:
      1. Use Rc when:
         - Multiple parts of your code need ownership
         - You know the sharing is single-threaded
         - The lifetime can't be statically determined

      2. Use Arc instead when:
         - You need thread-safe sharing
         - Multiple threads need ownership

      3. Rc limitations:
         - Not thread-safe
         - Slight runtime overhead
         - Can't break reference cycles automatically

      Best practices:
      1. Prefer unique ownership when possible
      2. Use Rc for single-threaded shared ownership
      3. Use Arc for multi-threaded scenarios
      4. Combine with Weak to prevent reference cycles

      RefCell and RwLock serve similar purposes but in different contexts:

      2. RwLock:

         - Has synchronization overhead
         - Can block threads instead of panicking

      Best practices:
      1. Use RefCell for single-threaded interior mutability
      2. Use RwLock when thread safety is needed
      3. Consider Mutex for simpler thread-safe mutability

      This code demonstrates a classic deadlock scenario. Here's how to fix it:

      // Correct way - Release lock before acquiring it again
      fn safe_mutex() {
          let lock = Arc::new(Mutex::new(42));
          
          {
              let mut data = lock.lock().unwrap();
              *data += 1;
          } // Lock is released here
          
          // Now we can acquire it again
          let data2 = lock.lock().unwrap();
          println!("Value: {}", data2);

      // Using multiple mutexes safely

          let guard2 = lock2.lock().unwrap();

      Best practices to prevent deadlocks:
      1. Keep critical sections small
      2. Release locks promptly using scopes
      3. Acquire multiple locks in a consistent order
      4. Use parking_lot::Mutex for better performance
      5. Consider using RwLock for read-heavy workloads

          }

          fn write(&mut self, content: &str) -> io::Result<()> {
              self.file.write_all(content.as_bytes())
          }
      }

      impl Drop for FileWrapper {
          fn drop(&mut self) {
              // Ensure file is properly closed
              // Could also do cleanup like deletion
              println!("Closing file: {}", self.path);
          }
      }
      ```

      RAII Patterns:
      1. Constructor acquires resources
      2. Methods use resources safely
      3. Drop releases resources
      4. Use `?` for error propagation

      Best practices:
      1. Implement Drop for custom resource types
      2. Keep resource management simple and obvious
      3. Use standard library types when possible
      4. Document cleanup behavior
      5. Consider using guard patterns for scoped operations

      Let's understand Copy vs Clone in detail:

      ```rust
      // Types that can be Copy
      #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
      struct Point {
          x: i32,
          y: i32,
      }

      // Types that can only be Clone
      #[derive(Clone)]
      struct ComplexData {
          name: String,    // String can't be Copy
          points: Vec<i32> // Vec can't be Copy
      }

      // Manual implementation example
      #[derive(Debug)]
      struct Custom {
          data: Vec<i32>,
          identifier: u32,
      }

      impl Clone for Custom {
          fn clone(&self) -> Self {
              Custom {
                  data: self.data.clone(),
                  identifier: self.identifier,  // Copy type
              }
          }
      }
      ```

      Key differences:
      1. Copy:
         - Implicit, bitwise copy
         - Must be Copy-safe (no heap allocations)
         - Typically for small, stack-only types
         
      2. Clone:
         - Explicit, potentially deep copy
         - Can handle heap allocations
         - More flexible but potentially expensive

      Best practices:
      1. Implement Copy for small, stack-only types
      2. Use Clone for types with owned resources
      3. Document performance implications of Clone
      4. Consider custom Clone implementations for optimization
      5. Be cautious with automatic derivation

      Let's break down struct memory layout and optimization:

      ```rust
      // Original: 24 bytes
      struct Metadata {
          id: u32,     // 4 bytes + 4 padding
          name: String, // 8 bytes (pointer)
          active: bool  // 1 byte + 7 padding
      }

      // Optimized: 16 bytes
      struct OptimizedMetadata {
          name: String,   // 8 bytes
          id: u32,       // 4 bytes
          active: bool    // 1 byte + 3 padding
      }

      // Further optimization with packing
      #[repr(packed)]
      struct PackedMetadata {
          id: u32,
          active: bool,
          name: String,
      }
      ```

      Memory layout considerations:
      1. Alignment requirements:
         - u32: 4-byte alignment
         - String: 8-byte alignment (64-bit pointer)
         - bool: 1-byte alignment

      2. Field ordering strategies:
         - Group similar-sized fields
         - Put larger alignments first
         - Consider cache line optimization

      Best practices:
      1. Order fields from largest to smallest
      2. Use appropriate integer sizes
      3. Consider using Option for optional fields
      4. Document size-critical structs
      5. Use #[repr(packed)] carefully - it can affect performance

      Rust's zero-cost abstractions compile to equivalent efficient code:

      trait ZeroCost {
          fn process(&self) -> u32;

          }
      }

      // Compiles to essentially the same code as:
      fn manual_process(range: Range<u32>) -> u32 {
          let mut sum = 0;
          let mut i = range.start;
          while i < range.end {
              sum += i;
              i += 1;
          }
          sum

      // Even more abstractions, still zero-cost
      fn complex_processing<T>(data: &[T]) -> u32 
      where T: AsRef<str> {
          data.iter()
              .map(|s| s.as_ref().len())
              .filter(|&n| n > 3)
              .fold(0, |acc, n| acc + n as u32)
      }
      ```

      Key principles:
      1. What you don't use, you don't pay for
      2. What you do use, you couldn't hand-code better

      Best practices:
      1. Use high-level abstractions freely
      2. Trust the compiler's optimizations
      3. Profile before optimizing
      4. Focus on readability first
      5. Use iterators and closures without fear
