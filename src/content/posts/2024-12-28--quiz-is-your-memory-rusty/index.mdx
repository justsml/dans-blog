      What happens when you run this code? Try to predict the output or error:
      ```rust
      fn main() {
          let philosopher = String::from("Zeno of Citium");
          let greeting = philosopher;  // What happens here?

          println!("Hello, {}!", philosopher);
      }
      ```
    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code fails to compile because of Rust's ownership rules. When we assign `philosopher` to `greeting`, the ownership of the String is moved to `greeting`. After this move, `philosopher` is no longer valid to use.

      Here are three ways to fix this:

      1. Clone the string (creates a new copy):
      ```rust
      let greeting = philosopher.clone();
      ```

      2. Use a reference (borrows the value):
      ```rust
      let greeting = &philosopher;
      ```

      3. Use a string slice (borrows part of the string):
      ```rust
      let greeting = &philosopher[..];
      ```

      Each solution has different use cases and performance implications. Cloning is more expensive but gives you ownership, while references are cheaper but have lifetime constraints.

      What happens when you run this code? Think about ownership transfer:
      ```rust
      fn take_ownership(text: String) {  // What happens to ownership here?
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
      }

      fn main() {

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      The code fails to compile because `wisdom` is moved into `take_ownership` and can't be used afterward.

      Here are three ways to fix this issue:

      1. Pass by reference (borrow the value):
      ```rust
      fn borrow_it(text: &String) {
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
      }
      borrow_it(&wisdom);  // Now wisdom can be used after
      ```

      2. Clone the value (create a new copy):
      ```rust
      take_ownership(wisdom.clone());  // Original wisdom remains valid
      ```

      3. Return ownership from the function:
      ```rust
      fn take_and_return(text: String) -> String {
          println!("Inside: {}", text);
          text  // Return ownership back
      }
      let wisdom = take_and_return(wisdom);  // Reassign returned ownership
      ```

      Each approach has different use cases:
      - References: Most efficient, but need lifetime management
      - Cloning: Simple but potentially expensive
      - Returning ownership: Useful for transforming values

      Best practice: Use references unless you need ownership transfer.

      ```
      Think about Rust's rules for mutable references.
    </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
    <div className="explanation">
      This code violates Rust's fundamental borrowing rules:
      - Only ONE mutable reference to a value at a time
      - OR any number of immutable references
      - References cannot outlive their referent

      Here's how to fix the code:

      1. Use sequential scoping:
      ```rust
      let mut wisdom = String::from("He who laughs at");
      {
          let ref1 = &mut wisdom;
          ref1.push_str(" himself never runs");
      }  // ref1 goes out of scope
      let ref2 = &mut wisdom;  // Now this is valid
      ref2.push_str(" out of things to laugh at.");
      ```

      2. Or modify the string in a single borrow:
      ```rust
      let mut wisdom = String::from("He who laughs at");
      let ref1 = &mut wisdom;
      ref1.push_str(" himself never runs out of things to laugh at.");
      ```

      These rules prevent data races at compile time, making Rust thread-safe by default.

      Common pitfall: Trying to use multiple mutable references to avoid cloning or
      to modify different parts of the same value simultaneously.

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    This compiles due to Rust's lifetime elision rules. The compiler automatically assigns lifetimes in simple cases.

    The above is equivalent to:
    ```rust
    fn first_cat<'a>(
        s: &'a str
    ) -> &'a str {
        // ...
    }
    ```

    Elision rules:
    1. Each parameter gets its own lifetime
    2. If there's exactly one input lifetime, it's assigned to all outputs
    3. If there's a `&self` parameter, its lifetime is assigned to all outputs

    _Oh no, infinite cat `Box\<\>`!_
    
    This recursive type has infinite size at compile time. Rust needs to know the size of types at compile time, but `CatList` contains itself, creating an infinite cycle.

    Fix using `Box<T>`:
    ```rust
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum CatList {
        Cons(i32, Box<CatList>),
        Nil,

    `Box<T>` provides a known-size pointer to heap-allocated data.

    `Rc<T>` (Reference Counting) allows multiple ownership by tracking the number of references to a value.

    3. `aurelius` clone: count = 3

    The compiler needs lifetime annotations to determine how the lifetimes of the input parameters relate to the return value's lifetime.

    Correct version:

      text2: &'a str

    `Weak<T>` references don't prevent deallocation of their targets. When all strong references (`Rc<T>`) are dropped, the value is deallocated even if weak references exist.

    Key points:
    - `Weak::upgrade()` returns `Option<Rc<T>>`
    - Useful for breaking reference cycles
    - Common in tree/graph structures where parent-child relationships exist

    Example cycle prevention:
    ```rust
    struct Node {
        next: Option<Rc<Node>>,
        prev: Option<Weak<Node>>, // Weak to prevent cycles
    }
    ```

    What happens to the file handle in this code?
    ```rust
    use std::fs::File;
    
    struct FileWrapper {
        file: File,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let file = File::create("test.txt").unwrap();
        let wrapper = FileWrapper { file };
        // ... use wrapper ...
        // No Drop implementation
    }

    This demonstrates RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in Rust. 
    The `File` type implements `Drop`, so it's automatically closed when `wrapper` 
    goes out of scope.

    You could also implement custom cleanup:
    ```rust
    impl Drop for FileWrapper {
        fn drop(&mut self) {
            // Additional cleanup if needed
        }
    }

    This demonstrates the difference between Copy and Clone:
    - `Copy` is implicit, bitwise, and for stack-only data
    - `Clone` is explicit, can be customized, and works with heap data
    
    When to use each:
    ```rust
    // Use Copy for small, stack-only types
    #[derive(Copy, Clone)]
    struct Point(i32, i32);

    // Use Clone for types with heap data
    #[derive(Clone)]
    struct Text {
        content: String, // heap-allocated

    What's the size of this struct on a 64-bit system?
    ```rust
    struct Metadata {

    Memory layout optimization is crucial for performance:
    
    ```rust
    // Optimized version - 16 bytes
    struct Metadata {
        name: String,  // 8 bytes
        id: u32,      // 4 bytes
        active: bool  // 1 byte + 3 padding
    }
    ```

    Key points:
    - Field ordering affects size due to alignment
    - String is just a pointer (8 bytes) on stack
    - Padding is added for alignment requirements
