## Welcome to the Security Theater

<blockquote class="inset">
WARNING: Patch may contain today's fixes and tomorrow's vulnerabilities.
</blockquote>

Every security patch is a gift to attackers—a blueprint packed with binary diffs and behavioral changes, ripe for reverse engineering.

<blockquote>
"Oh look, they fixed _that_ buffer overflow. Wonder what else they missed?"
</blockquote>

Patching without confidence, experience, or recovery plans? Recipe for disaster.

The reality is messier than vendor promises. Ask any greybeard sysadmin about immediate updates and you'll hear hard-earned wisdom: "Wait six months. Don't be Microsoft's beta tester."

The IT team's impossible choice:

- Patch now: risk breaking production
- Patch later: risk getting pwned
- Don't patch: guarantee getting pwned
- Manual mitigation: harden configs, restrict weak ciphers, use longer keys—hope it's enough

_Welcome to Patch Tuesday—better known as Exploit Wednesday Eve._

## The Best Intentions

Patches kill systems too—no attackers required.

The CrowdStrike incident of July 2024 proved a harsh truth: following "best practices" offers no immunity when untested code crashes critical infrastructure. One flawed update grounded flights worldwide and sent hospitals back to paper charts.

But ignoring patches? That's guaranteeing exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

## The Lies We Tell Ourselves

Throwing money at security often backfires. Complex, layered controls become impossible to manage—and impossible to monitor means impossible to secure.

The right investment level? The optimal controls? The perfect security-usability balance?

It depends. (Yes, the consultant's favorite answer.)

But that's actually good news: personalized risk management beats one-size-fits-all every time.

## Quitting Security Theater

Adopt a proactive approach to risk management.

Document comprehensively: Assess your environment—identify organization-specific threat scenarios. Establish testing frequencies for incident response and data recovery plans. Define tolerances for downtime, data loss, and reputational harm. Clarify legal obligations to customers, partners, and shareholders in breach scenarios. Ensure employees understand their roles.


> Are there universal best practices? Yes, though implementation varies:

**Key Considerations**

- Adopt hardware security keys like YubiKeys for all users, or mandate passkeys at minimum.
  - OTPs are susceptible to social engineering; hardware tokens are not.
  - Require MFA on all services universally.
- Robust & verified backups.
  - Ensure cloud infrastructure has offline backups—ideally immutable and geographically dispersed.
    - "Offline" means cross-vendor or cross-account (e.g., AWS backups in GCP or Azure, or third-party solutions like Backblaze B2).
  - Extend backup strategies to employee devices, accounting for scenarios like unreliable conference Wi-Fi (aligning with SLAs and recovery objectives).
- Conduct quarterly recovery drills: restore full infrastructure in an unused region using backups, snapshots, and infrastructure-as-code tools.
- Place [CanaryTokens](https://canarytokens.org/) alongside any real credentials to be the first to know when a breach begins.

{/* upon an attempted unauthorized access or data exfiltration attempt. (use named credentials, and have fun with the bait credentials name: `accounting-svcs-infra`, `secure-auth-root`, `payroll-payment-svcs`, `enterprise-crypto-wallet`.) */}

## The Other Side of Fear

Define your risk profile: Consider factors like sensitive data access (banking/crypto), web applications (XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities), supply chain awareness, public-facing service exposure (zero-day risks), and tolerances for data loss, ransomware, reputational harm, or fines. Evaluate downtime affordability and whether backup recovery is more efficient than redeployment. Balance breach probabilities against mitigation costs and upgrade risks—adjust accordingly for each organization & situation.

{/* Trace attack paths through dependencies, infrastructure, inputs/outputs, etc. */}

The solution is neither glamorous nor monolithic. Implement multi-layered defenses: defense in depth, rotating offline backups, regular disaster drills, compensating controls, and recognizing patches as pragmatic necessities rather than infallible safeguards.

Deploy cautiously—automate where possible, stage updates with labels for sequencing, conduct rigorous testing, and prepare fallback plans for potential failures, especially in critical scenarios.
