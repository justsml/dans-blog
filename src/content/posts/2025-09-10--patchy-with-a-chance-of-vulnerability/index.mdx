## Welcome to the Security Theater

Every security patch is a blueprint for attackers. As IT teams race to test and deploy updates across complex infrastructures, threat actors reverse-engineer these fixes, extract vulnerability details, and weaponize exploits. The asymmetry is stark: vendors require weeks to develop patches, enterprises days to implement them, yet attackers can automatically analyze binaries and identify vulnerable systems in mere hours.

_Welcome to Patch Tuesday—now known as Exploit Wednesday Eve._

## The Best Intentions

Patches can pose risks all on their own, even without the threat of savvy attackers. The CrowdStrike incident of July 2024 revealed a harsh reality: following best practices doesn't guarantee safety, as patches introduce often untested code that can crash systems. A single flawed update crippled global air travel and healthcare, transforming airports into chaos and hospitals back in time 30 years. Conversely, ignoring critical patches, for any reason, can expose organizations to known vulnerabilities & liabilities.

## The Lies We Tell Ourselves

Excessive security spending doesn't guarantee immunity. Ironically, overinvestment can increase breach likelihood: layering complex controls creates burdensome systems that are difficult to support, integrate, maintain, and monitor effectively.

How do we determine the appropriate level of investment? The optimal countermeasures? The ideal balance between security and usability?

The answer is nuanced: it depends on your organization's unique context.

While subjective, this personalization allows tailored risk management—ideally guided by subject matter experts (SMEs).

## Quitting Security Theater

Adopt a proactive approach to risk management.

Document comprehensively: Assess your environment—identify organization-specific threat scenarios. Establish testing frequencies for incident response and data recovery plans. Define tolerances for downtime, data loss, and reputational harm. Clarify legal obligations to customers, partners, and shareholders in breach scenarios. Ensure employees understand their roles.

### Critical Components

> Are there universal best practices? Yes, though implementation varies:

- Adopt hardware security keys like YubiKeys for all users, or mandate passkeys at minimum.
  - OTPs are susceptible to social engineering; hardware tokens are not.
  - Require MFA on all services universally.
- Robust & verified backups.
  - Ensure cloud infrastructure has offline backups—ideally immutable and geographically dispersed.
    - "Offline" means cross-vendor or cross-account (e.g., AWS backups in GCP or Azure, or third-party solutions like Backblaze B2).
  - Extend backup strategies to employee devices, accounting for scenarios like unreliable conference Wi-Fi (aligning with SLAs and recovery objectives).
- Conduct quarterly recovery drills: restore full infrastructure in an unused region using backups, snapshots, and infrastructure-as-code tools.
- Place [CanaryTokens](https://canarytokens.org/) alongside any real credentials to be the first to know when a breach begins.

## The Other Side of Fear

Define your risk profile: Consider factors like sensitive data access (banking/crypto), web applications (XSS/CSRF vulnerabilities), supply chain awareness, insider threat knowledge, public-facing service exposure (zero-day risks), and tolerances for data loss, ransomware, reputational harm, or fines. Evaluate downtime affordability and whether backup recovery is more efficient than redeployment. Balance breach probabilities against mitigation costs and upgrade risks—adjust accordingly for each organization & situation.

{/* Trace attack paths through dependencies, infrastructure, inputs/outputs, etc. */}

The solution is neither glamorous nor monolithic. Implement multi-layered defenses: defense in depth, rotating offline backups, regular disaster drills, compensating controls, and recognizing patches as pragmatic necessities rather than infallible safeguards.

Deploy cautiously—automate where possible, stage updates with labels for sequencing, conduct rigorous testing, and prepare fallback plans for potential failures, especially in critical scenarios.
