# LLM-Powered Translations (i18n)

<p class="inset">In my previous post, I shared how I've been [using AI to enhance my content creation workflows.](/replacing-my-job-with-gpt-and-llm/) One of the most impactful applications has been **localizing content** for a global audience. By leveraging AI tools like GPT-4*, Llama 3, Mistral, and other (Large Language Models), I've been able to translate over 50 posts into many languages while maintaining cultural nuance.</p>

In this post, I'll dive deeper into how I've integrated AI-powered translations into my content creation pipeline, the benefits I've experienced, and the considerations to keep in mind when using these tools.

## Requirements

I wanted both component-level translations (for Button Labels, alt text) and full-page translations (for complete blog posts). I've worked with either approach at various companies, and each has left me missing features from the other approach.

### Must-Haves

- **Be Component-level:** I wanted to be able to translate individual substrings.
- **Support full page translations:** I wanted a way to translate entire posts. (1,500-30,000 tokens.)
- **Support multiple languages:** I needed a way to manage translations for many different languages.
- **Integrate with my existing Astro setup:** I wanted a solution that could seamlessly integrate with my Astro project.
- **Speed** I needed something that wouldn't interfere with my site's 99/100 Lighthouse score.
- **Flexibility:** I wanted to be able to easily switch between different translation services or models.
- **Cost-effective:** I needed a solution that wouldn't break the bank. (Free)
- **SEO-friendly:** I wanted a solution that wouldn't negatively impact my site's SEO.

### Nice-to-Haves

- **Customizable:** I wanted to be able to fine-tune translations for specific languages or regions.
- **Automated:** I wanted a solution that could automatically detect the language of a page and serve the appropriate translation.
- **Offline support:** I wanted a solution that could work offline or with intermittent internet connectivity.
- **Collaborative:** I wanted a solution that could support multiple contributors working on translations simultaneously.

## Component Translations

I've used a few different approaches to handle component-level translations in the past, from manual JSON files, to more robust solutions with [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) and 3rd party translation services. 

For my blog I wanted a lightweight solution that could handle translations for individual components, like button labels, alt text, and other small strings.

I ultimately decided to use the [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs/) plugin. It's a lightweight, flexible solution that works well with my existing Astro setup.

It relies on a config file w/ translations.

```json translations.json
{
  "en": {
    "button": {
      "submit": "Submit",
      "cancel": "Cancel"
    },
    "alt": {
      "logo": "Logo"
    }
  },
  "fr": {
    "button": {
      "submit": "Soumettre",
      "cancel": "Annuler"
    },
    "alt": {
      "logo": "Logo"
    }
  }
}
```

To add a new language, I wrote a simple script to send the JSON file to a translation service and update the config file with the translated strings.

```txt prompt.txt
Translate the following JSON dictionary file into Japanese.

{
  "en": {
    "button": {
      "submit": "Submit",
      "cancel": "Cancel"
    },
    "quiz": {
      "start": "Start Quiz",
      "explanation": "Show Explanation",
      "next": "Next Question",
      "checkScore": "Check Score"
    },
    "site": {
      "logo": "Logo"
    },
    "categories": {
      "quiz": "Quiz",
      "post": "Post",
      "about": "About"
    }
  }
}
```

From the prompt, the translation service would generate the following JSON file.

```json translations.json
{
  "en": {
    "button": {
      "submit": "Submit",
      "cancel": "Cancel"
    },
    "quiz": {
      "start": "Start Quiz",
      "explanation": "Show Explanation",
      "next": "Next Question",
      "checkScore": "Check Score"
    },
    "site": {
      "logo": "Logo"
    },
    "categories": {
      "quiz": "Quiz",
      "post": "Post",
      "about": "About"
    }
  },
  "ja": {
    "button": {
      "submit": "ÈÄÅ‰ø°",
      "cancel": "„Ç≠„É£„É≥„Çª„É´"
    },
    "quiz": {
      "start": "„ÇØ„Ç§„Ç∫„ÇíÈñãÂßã",
      "explanation": "Ë™¨Êòé„ÇíË°®Á§∫",
      "next": "Ê¨°„ÅÆË≥™Âïè",
      "checkScore": "„Çπ„Ç≥„Ç¢„ÇíÁ¢∫Ë™ç"
    },
    "site": {
      "logo": "„É≠„Ç¥"
    },
    "categories": {
      "quiz": "„ÇØ„Ç§„Ç∫",
      "post": "ÊäïÁ®ø",
      "about": "Ê¶ÇË¶Å"
    }
  }
}
```


## Solution: LLM-Powered Translations

I've used many translation services in the past, from humble JSON files to Google Translate. But with the rise of LLMs, I wanted to see how they could improve my translation workflows.

### Step 1: Setting Up the LLM

I used LMStudio to fine-tune my translation prompts against many local models, models & configurations. I also used services including GPT-4, Claude Sonnet, to compare with.

Part of the challenge was training the model to understand my content.

A key insight was using the LLM to analyze each page, and generate a tailored prompt specific to each language (and possibly country.)

```text
Generate a prompt for translating this page into French, include any recent and cultural concerns. Maintain a similar tone and style.
```

 understand the nuances of my content, anticipating embarrassing cultural mixups and produce more accurate translations. Claude let me know "root" might be appropriate in some english-speaking countries, but in Australia it is slang I best avoid. üòÇ Touche, mon ami.


I trained it on a mix of my existing posts and translations to create a custom model that could handle my content's nuances.

There's a few options for Astro i18n (internationalization) support, but I've chosen to use the [Paraglide](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs/) plugin. It's a lightweight, flexible solution that works well with my existing Astro setup.
