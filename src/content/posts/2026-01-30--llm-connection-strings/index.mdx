Don't you miss when every database required a miscellaneous grab-bag of environment variables?

| A tower of delicate config, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME`... Shit, or was it `DB_USERNAME` or `DB_USER`? F*ck, is it `DB_PASS`, not `DB_PASSWORD`? When do I need those `PG_*` prefixes! And, how do I set the timeout?! Ah! 


Then someone had the brilliant idea to just use a URL¹:

```sh
postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
```

One string. Everything you need. Universally parseable. Portable. Dare I say, beautiful even.

What if we just... ~~stole~~ borrowed the DB URL idea?

## Introducing LLM Connection Strings

```sh
llm://api.openai.com/gpt-5.2?temp=0.7&max_tokens=1500
llm://api.z.ai/glm-4.7?top_p=0.9&cache=true
```

### The Parts of an LLM Connection String

![the parts of a LLM connection string](./inline-url-diagram-dark.svg)

{/* Where the scheme is `llm://`, the host is the provider's API base URL, the path is the model name, and query parameters handle all the runtime options. */}

## Need auth? Great, add it!

```sh
llm://app-name:password@api.openai.com/gpt-5.2?temp=0.7&max_tokens=1500
```

Also, be careful. Credentials in URLs can be a security risk if logged or exposed. Though the good news is they are likely to be scrubbed automatically in many hosted logging services. Verify & use with caution, etc.

## Resiliency? Sure, why the hell not!

Specify round-robin host CSV for failover! Many DB libraries support this today!

```sh
llms://primary.gpt,backup.gpt/gpt-6?temp=0.9
```

That `s` in `llms://` isn't a typo, it's a ~~pluralization joke~~ hint there's multiple hosts.

<blockquote class="inset">One string with everything from your **auth** to your **endpoint**.</blockquote>

## Alternative Formats

I'm not married to `llm://`.

I could imagine some use cases better met with a more provider-centric protocol format, for example, a local LLM router could spin up a local `ollama://` service:

```sh
ollama://localhost:11434/llama3
vercel://anthropic/sonnet-4.5?temp=0.8&web_search={"maxUses":3}
bedrock://us-west-2.aws/anthropic/sonnet-4.5?temp=0.8&cacheControl=ephemeral
```

Regardless of the exact scheme, the core idea is the same: **one string to rule them all**.

- You can copy & paste in and out of forms without hunting a dozen fields.
- You can pass them as a single CLI argument. (Sure, with quoting, but still easier than a dozen env vars.)
- You get URL parsing for 'free' in every language. Query parameters can handle complex options via namespaced keys, or JSON encoding (with URL escaping.)
