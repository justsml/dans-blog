## RegEx Denial-of-Service: ReDOS

One of the more suprising, and yet hard-to-spot vulnerabilities I've found is related to regular expressions.
Either poorly written or poorly implemented.

Memory/CPU can be exhausted with large or specially crafted user input.

> This is not as much a security issue, but a **performance issue.**

### Warning Signs

1. You have multiple capture groups
2. Global matching
3. Expression is used with un-checked user input

### Mitigation / Resolution

1. RegEx is hard.
    1.  For example, here is how the really smart folks at [OWASP recommend handling IP validation][owasp]: `^(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)$`
    2.  That's longer than an (old school) tweet, for a 4-byte IP Address!!!
2. Make sure user input isn't improperly formatted.
3. This affects almost every language and platform .NET/Node/Python/PERL/Java
