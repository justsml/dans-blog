> Spotting Promise Anti-Patterns in google search results, and popular libraries.

Let me start with a confession: I'm guilty of writing the same 'anti-patterns' I criticize below, as I'm sure many JS developers are as well. Nothing I've laid out is meant to be personal or even directed at the original authors. I'm merely doing a code review on common patterns - I hope to pass along an understanding of my priorities & critical thinking processes.

This is a pretty solid article. I only have 1 concern:

### Q Library

The Q library is one of the most used & oldest to be associated with "Promises." Hence it suffers from aging examples and it's need to maintain backwards compatibility.
**I say "associated with 'Promises'" since I feel Q is really about the `deferred` pattern.**

It may resemble Promises, however I insist it ain't. It has far too large a surface area for all the wrong reasons. Also the naming convention inconsistently abbreviates names, making it harder to memorize the interface. Methods like `when` and `done` are not necessary.

Bottom line: the `deferred` pattern is a painful anti-pattern - it improves virtually nothing over the typical callback approach.
