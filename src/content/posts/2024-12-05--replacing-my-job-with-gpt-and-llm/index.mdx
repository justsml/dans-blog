In recent months, I've found myself increasingly relying on AI tools to handle repetitive tasks in my workflow. What started as a project to find out how well AI tools could create educational content has evolved into a reassuring reminder that humans are still in the early days of getting rocks to think, never mind guess-next-word-good‚Ñ¢Ô∏è.

## The Challenge of Multiple Choice Assessments

One of my favorite teaching tools is ***the multiple-choice question!*** And yes, I actually get paid to write them. So naturally, I wanted to see if the latest LLMs could give me an assist - especially since I frequently get requests for tech I've never (or barely) used.

Here's the thing: it's **tough to craft a good question, never mind a set of questions!** Quality distractors are especially difficult. A well-crafted question can quickly test attention to detail, ability to adapt & apply knowledge, and even trip up the occasional expert.

It‚Äôs pretty easy to spot a ‚Äúbad‚Äù question. Often they reveal lack of familiarity with best practices, real world gotchas, recent changes, debated nuances, etc.

I've worked with exceptional (human) curriculum writers who struggled with multiple choice content. So how close could AI get?

## My AI Journey: A Timeline

1. First attempt: No.
2. Tune/test prompt on Claude, ChatGPT, Llama, Gemma, Mistral Dolphin.
3. Repeat step 2.
4. No, seriously. Lots more 2.
5. How is it this dumb?
6. How am I this dumb?
7. Ok, some of this might be useful.
8. Maybe‚Ä¶
9. Claude, you're good at PSPS: "Plausible shit, pretty slow‚Ñ¢Ô∏è"

## The Current State of AI-Assisted Question Writing

By Summer 2024, Anthropic's Claude showed promise in generating decent questions. That‚Äôs some of the battle‚Ä¶ However, it still needed extensive guidance: specific code fragments, concepts, highlighted misconceptions - sometimes requiring so much detail that I it felt like I was practically re-writing the content 3x over myself.

While I typically delete (or re-write) 99.5% of AI-generated content, it's not all waste. I usually average 1-2 extra questions per quiz thanks to LLMs - that's a 15% output boost!

The main issues? AI-generated content often suffers from overly formal or hokey tone, bad or obvious distractors, and occasionally incorrect or self-contradicting explanations.

## The Human Touch: What AI Still Can't Do

Experience-based insights, like knowing that shell environments handle integer arithmetic but not fractions (try dividing 1/2 versus 4/2), are still uniquely human territory.

AI particularly struggles with two crucial aspects:

- The strategic interplay between question order and distractor patterns
- Understanding human psychology in question design:
    - The power of super-close-but-not-quite options
    - Leveraging familiar but rarely-used concepts
    - Strategic use of adjacent technology concepts to create challenging distractors
    - Crafting questions that invite multiple solving strategies

## The Art of Distraction

Creating effective distractors (wrong answers) requires deep understanding of how humans think and learn. For instance, when testing database concepts, you might include terms like `CONCAT`, `COMBINE`, or `PIPE` alongside `JOIN` and `UNION` - i.e. terms that are related, or overlap with concepts from other databases and languages.

## Conclusion

While AI tools have become valuable assistants in content creation, they're far from replacing human expertise. The nuanced understanding of learning psychology, technical concepts, and question design strategy remains firmly in human territory - at least for now.

While the first [15+ Quizzes](/challenges) I published have been 100% free of AI/ML generated content, I'm hoping to continue to explore the potential of AI in educational content creation.

## What's Next?

Stay tuned! I'll be posting more on my journey developing high quality + rigorous educational material - with a bit of help from our AI overlords! ü§ñüöÄ
