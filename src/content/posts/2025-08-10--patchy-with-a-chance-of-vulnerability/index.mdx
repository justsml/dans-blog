## Security Theater, vol 3

### Patches all the way down

A critical vulnerability drops: remote code execution, affecting everything from smart toasters to enterprise servers. The usual Tuesday fare.

IT pros face the eternal dilemma: Patch now and risk breaking what works, or mitigate the problem, and hope you did it right?

Don't worry, either way there's a chance your customer database leaks onto a darknet forum.

Welcome to the schadenfreude of software patching, where every choice is wrong and the points don't matter.

## The Security Lie We Tell Ourselves to Feel Safe

Think security vulnerabilities are just software mistakes fixed by patches? That's the optimistic myth.

In truth, patches are a triple threat:

1. A potential fix tailored to your setup and risks
1. A blueprint revealing the vulnerability
1. Unrelated change(s) (dutifully documented, `Changelog: misc improvements`)

The nightmare fuel: Patches expose implementation details, odd patterns, and trade-offs that scream "dig here" to attackers. They tell users "install" and "don't ask too many questions."

## Patch Tuesday, Exploit Wednesday

> "Just keep your software updated!"  
> — Every security expert who's never touched production

Most updates—binaries, websites, drivers, apps—are ripe for diff analysis and reverse engineering. Tools (and now AI) spotlight changes, infer flaws, and accelerate exploits. Hence, Patch Tuesday often births Exploit Wednesday.

Flashback to 2021: Microsoft's KB5001330 "quality update" fixed printing issues but caused printers to develop digital amnesia. Skip it? You're exposed to PrintNightmare, letting anyone print malware remotely.

Choices: Install and lose printing; skip and invite chaos; or wait six hours for reverse-engineering to weaponize it.

The asymmetry stings: Vendors take weeks to fix; attackers need hours to diff. Enterprises roll out in days; attackers scan in minutes.

## The CrowdStrike Incident: When the Cure Becomes the Disease

July 19, 2024: One bad CrowdStrike update triggered a global Blue Screen symphony, turning airports into disaster flicks and hospitals into paper-chart relics. Somewhere, a CISO polished their LinkedIn.

Post-mortems gloss over this: Victims followed best practices. They did everything right—which is why it all went wrong. The protective patch became the destroyer.

The truth: Patches are essential, yet carry risk. They also  fixing holes while spotlighting them.

They only target known knowns, and come with their own risks.

Patches aren't magic spells; they're necessary evils.

## What Actually Works (Spoiler: It's Complicated)

Defense in Depth is the only way to survive this patchy world. Layered security, compensating controls, and a healthy dose of paranoia.



### For Builders and Vendors

**Minimize diff surface**: Keep security patches laser-focused—no refactors or cleanups. Save improvements for later.

**Commit hygiene**: Vague is better: "Fix bounds check" over exploit spoilers. Save details for post-adoption post-mortems.

**Silent or staged rollouts**: Ship protections quietly first, disclose later. For open source, coordinate and batch low-signal fixes.

**Defense-in-depth**: Layer invariants, validation, sandboxing, and kill switches. Patches fix; posture protects.

### For Operators and Defenders

**Patch fast where it counts**: Prioritize internet-facing and high-privilege assets. Use real maintenance windows. Track your adversaries' exploitation timelines.

**Compensate during delays**: Deploy WAF/IPS rules, virtual patches, feature flags, egress filters, rate limits, and segmentation to shrink blast radius.

**Monitor post-patch**: Exploitation surges after advisories. Amp logging and alerts on affected systems.

**Test adversarially**: Mimic attackers reading diffs. Check regressions and probe revealed seams.

## The Economics of Digital Dice Games

Tally patching costs: Testing, downtime, rollbacks, help desk chaos, consulting fees, IT therapy.

Now breach costs: Ransomware, fines, lawsuits, CEO exits.

Both can exceed revenues. This is normal. This is fine.

## Common Objections, Briefly Roasted

- **"But transparency!"** Be honest to defenders without gifting PoCs. Timing matters—don't be stupid.

- **"Security through obscurity fails."** Reducing signals isn't hiding; it's smart. No billboards for flaws.

- **"Open source can't hide diffs."** It can minimize drawing attention to changes, coordinate with maintainers, add mitigations, and communicate with users. Open ≠ reckless.

- **"Patch everything immediately!"** That's code for "test in prod and pray."

## Embracing the Suck: A Conclusion

No winning with patches: Apply and risk breakage plus attacker insights; delay and invite breaches.

Each patch admits failure but hopes for net gains. (Spoiler: Hope is the fuel.)

Treat patches as press releases to attackers: Minimize intel, hike their costs, shrink your window.

We've built a vast digital life on sand, made out of literal _rocks_ we've taught to think.

Patches breed vulnerabilities. Less known vulnerabilities. That's the feature.

I need to update my Chrome. Well, not right now. I'm busy. Find comfort in knowing it's only a matter of time before my endpoint protection crashes and reboots my machine. I'll update then, yeah, definitely.
