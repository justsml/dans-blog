## Robotic Cars: More or Less Crashes?

Google's self-driving cars are apparently in 2x as many accidents as human drivers - If you think this is just buggy new tech, way too complex from the get-go - well, you're partially right. [An important detail I should share: as of Dec 2015 virtually **all accidents were not the robots fault.**](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-18/humans-are-slamming-into-driverless-cars-and-exposing-a-key-flaw)

The accidents are **caused by humans drivers** unfamiliar with robotic drivers. Furthermore, Google has programmed the cars to obey the law in absolute terms - never speeding, difficulty merging in dense or fast freeway traffic.
This opens up a bunch of legal, ethical questions (this is known as [the trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)) -

- Is it ever ok:
  - to avoid a rear-end collision if it means driving past the walkway at a red light **assuming path is clear** ?
  - to drive on the sidewalk to avoid a bicycle cutting across lanes? - is it ok for AI to accept this breach in 'rules of the road'

I understand Google's approach, especially when trying to minimize liability: always follow the rules - logically it follows that you cannot really be at fault if you **always** observe the law.

There would be **massive liability** if an accident happened because of intentionally designed 'flexibility' around the laws.

### Don't let the future escape us

The future will still arrive, even if the robots drive like octagenarians.

Perhaps a simple fix for now would be to use bright red flashing LEDs (think school buses) to warn human drivers they are about to rear-end an innocent robot.

I would be more comfortable with a car which had tiers of observance and rule adherance. To my mind this would be much closer to how humans drive.

Imagine 3-tiers of system-perception as follows: (decision & other layers omitted for simplicity)

1.  base: follows laws with annoying precision
2.  local: flexibile adjustments based on current traffic - to allow merge on the highway if say, 10MPH+ is needed. Conversely if the traffic is simply going too fast, the car should be smart enough to pull over to avoid being a nuissance to other drivers.
3.  360: calculate ANY potential extreme collision risk/avoidance measures - driving on a shoulder or

This would likely require a smart balancing act - say tier 1 detects an immenent accident which cannot be avoided following the laws, it would then shift all processor power into tier 3 - hopefully finding a creative way to avoid harm.

Robotic cars are on the cusp of being technically smarter & faster than any human driver. Accept it. Welcome it.
