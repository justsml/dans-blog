Recently, I embarked on a journey to upgrade my 8+ year-old Gatsby v1 site.

This blog post will share some lessons I learned during this process and the fun technologies I explored.

## Project Requirements

Before diving into the upgrade, I established a set of requirements:

Since my blog gets a highly variable number of daily page views, I felt a statically pre-generated site would give the performance I wanted without extra complexity.

Also, I needed to keep this site's existing content and features, including:

- Code highlighting
- Comments
- Site Search
- Pre-existing React components: Quiz UI, Gist embeds
- Contact form
- Responsive images
- Sub 1-second load time
- Browser compatibility: 2018+
- Automated + PR-based deployments

## Choosing my Right Technology Stack

Over the years I have worked with many static site tools, from Jekyll, Hugo, Slate, and Gatsby. As well as many front-end frameworks: Ember, Knockout, Angular, Vue and of course React.

So, I have precisely too many options, which I ultimately narrowed down to **Remix**, **Next.js** and **Astro**,

I could write an entire blog series on my evaluation process, but I'll summarize it here:

<p class="breakout">I chose [Astro](https://astro.build) because of how quickly I could _do meaningful things_.</p>

Their API design is refreshingly simple. It's a [great balance between flexibility and good design opinions.](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/)

It was a bit reassuring that Astro lacks any obvious cloud bias or framework agenda.

Astro wasn't the only technology I used, here's a full run down of the stack:

- [Astro](https://astro.build): A modern static site generator.
- [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com): A collection of re-usable components.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework.
- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com): Markdown content + inline components.
- [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app): Fast, static & offline site search library. No need for Algolia!
- [Utterances](https://utteranc.es): Comments system based on GitHub issues.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com): Automated deployments, contact form w/ captcha.

## Astro: Learning Curve and Key Features

<p class="breakout quote">Astro quickly became the cornerstone of my upgrade.</p>

Here are some key features I found particularly useful:

- `.astro` files: At first glance, Astro components may look like React JSX components, however they are quite different and serve a different set of goals. (See comparison table below.)
- Powered by Vite under the hood - it just works. Seamlessly handles ESM/CJS, TypeScript, code bundling, styles, images, etc.
- [No framework bias](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/framework-components/#official-ui-framework-integrations) or [cloud bias.](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/) (*Cough* Next.js, OpenNext)
- [Static vs. hybrid](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/rendering-modes/) rendering: Astro provides [flexibility to target most cloud platforms](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/deploy/): AWS, GCP, Firebase, Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Azure, Fly.io, and many others.
- Content collections: The [`getCollection`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/api-reference/#getcollection) API simplifies working with content files as a data source.
- File-based routing: Astro's file-based routing system, combined with `getStaticPaths`, makes generating pages a breeze.
- SEO: [Astro doesn't get in your way](https://github.com/justsml/dans-blog/blob/010c5cb58bb327adb8c8fff608594daa612ad9d5/src/components/BaseHead.astro#L43-L63), and only emits a minimal amount of ~~detritus~~ boilerplate (`astro-island`) when necessary.

Some things were a little surprising, like styling around Astro's injected markup, and the effect of `display:contents`.

```tsx
<style>astro-island,astro-slot,astro-static-slot{display:contents}</style>
```

### Comparing `.astro` vs. Client Components

| Use browser-only APIs                                                              | ❌ | ✅ |
| Use custom hooks that depend on state, effects, or browser-only APIs               | ❌ | ✅ |


## Modern CSS: Wow

Coming back to frontend development, I was delighted by the advancements in native CSS:

- CSS Variables: Available for a while, and pretty stable across browsers since 202\*.
- Nesting: Finally in spec, and without earlier awkward syntax. Now it's similar to Less or SCSS.
- New selectors: [`:is()`, `:where()`, and `:has()`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ncFpP8GP4g) offer more precise targeting of elements.
- Modern units like `ch`, `vw`, and functions like `clamp()` provide better control over layouts and typography.
- Set spacing more naturally with `-inline` and `-block` attributes. Set padding or margin on either the horizontal or vertical axis. Instead of `margin: 0 1rem 0 1rem` → `margin-inline: 1rem`.
- Advanced layouts: Re-learning CSS Grid. Wow, there's a lot of shit in there. It can be daunting with seemingly endless ways of using it. Keep in mind, you can get away with figuring out 1 or 2 ways. Check out these great resources that helped me do tricks with grid: [Kevin Powell's video: Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg7Fvvl3taU), [Responsive w/o media queries](https://ardilamorin.com/responsive-no-media-queries/), [Ten modern layouts in one line of CSS](https://web.dev/articles/one-line-layouts).

## Search: Pagefind

Implementing a **site search** without 3rd party services or database hosting seemed like a fun challenge. After all, it's not like I have 10,000 posts to index (yet.)

While browsing [Astro's community integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/?search=find) I stumbled upon a fantastic tool I wish I had known about sooner: [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).

<p class="breakout quote">Few tools solve any problem as well as Pagefind solves local site search.</p>

The simplicity of implementing Pagefind is a delight. It can integrated with ANY static site content, and you can choose if you want a default UI, or you can build anything custom if you choose.

It neatly solved for everything I wanted. It took only minutes to integrate, and most of the work involved adding a `<div id="search"></div>` tag and some styling!

## Comments: Utterances

Unfortunately, I had to say goodbye to Disqus and the comments I'd accumulated over 7+ years.

I wanted better control/visibility into the 3rd party scripts on my site.

Also, it needs to be simple & maintainable.

This lead me to chose the fantastic [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) service. Its GitHub (issues-based) comments system lines up well with my audience. Plus, it's easy to set up, and free.

## Tailwind: Regrets

There's only one bit of technology I'm increasingly regretting using: Tailwind.

Over time, I can feel the cost difference in writing vs. maintaining. Tailwind is so fast to write, however once it's complex enough, it can become tedious to read & extend.

## Conclusion

Upgrading my old Gatsby v1 site to a modern stack built around Astro was a fun experience. 10/10 would recommend.

If you're considering upgrading an old site or building a new static (or hybrid) site, I highly recommend looking at Astro. The learning curve may be steep at times, but the benefits in terms of performance, developer experience, and future-proofing your project are well worth the effort.
