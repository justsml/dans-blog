Does your company suffer from `low-H`? (_Hustle_, not heroin.)

Or `low-F`? (As in _no fucks left._)

No worries, the **big boss** has figured it out!

- It's culture! We need to read a book! Or, hire a consultant! Company offsite? Hawaii? _So cultured!_
- It's values! _Embrace your new mandated values!_
- Actually, it's people's _perception_. Stupid people. _Rebranding time!_
- We forgot, we need to hire an adult. A `savior`! Someone who will fix everything. Someone from a real company, respected by friends & enemies alike. Someone who clearly spent a [pretentious amount of time on their website.](https://danlevy.net).
- The savior said we need to be data-driven. Duh, dummies. Now, we _drive data!_ Make charts go up and to the right, brrr!
- Funny story, turns out it's the staff. `Fire key/random people.` _Let folks know we're serious._

<blockquote style="margin-block: 2rem; width: 60%;">**Ad:** If your engineering organization is hiring a `savior`, please [reach out](/docs/resume.pdf) to learn about the latest SaaS (Savior as a Service) from Dan!</blockquote>

  <p>Is your `<Insert Dept. Name>` in chaos?</p>

  <p>Was it the layoffs? (Err, _strategic adjustment._) No, no, it can't be that...</p>

  <p>Don't worry about causes, the company has a fix!</p>
  <p>Enter: A `savior`! Someone to fix everything!</p>
  
  <p><b>Spoiler:</b> It's always "data." The "fix" is (unironically) always Jira.</p>

  <p>So, you raised a big round? Time to spend it all!</p>

  <p>Now it's time to `raise the bar`! (Euphamism for _hire & fire people!_)</p>

  <h3>Book Decoder Ring</h3>

  {/* The selection of a book club book says a lot about where a company's heading. It can be a way to set the tone for the next quarter, or telegraph imminent layoffs. */}

  While many of these books are fantastic & highly recommended, that **doesn't need to get in the way of folks mis-using, mis-understanding, and mis-applying them!**
