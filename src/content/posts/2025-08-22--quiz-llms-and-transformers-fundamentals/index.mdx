  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about what fundamentally distinguishes modern LLMs from earlier NLP approaches.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Large Language Models are neural networks, specifically transformer-based architectures, trained on massive datasets of text to learn patterns in language. They can generate, understand, and manipulate text through learned representations rather than explicit rules.

    **Why other options are wrong:**
    - Rule-based systems require hand-crafted linguistic rules, unlike LLMs that learn patterns from data
    - LLMs work with unstructured text data, not just structured data
    - Traditional ML algorithms typically can't handle the complexity and scale of language understanding that LLMs achieve
    - Expert systems rely on explicitly programmed knowledge, while LLMs learn implicitly from training data
    - Symbolic AI uses logical representations, while LLMs use distributed neural representations

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The Transformer architecture's breakthrough was the self-attention mechanism, which allows models to directly attend to all positions in a sequence simultaneously, eliminating the need for recurrent connections and enabling much better parallelization during training.

    **Why other architectures fell short:**
    - RNNs and LSTMs process sequences sequentially, creating bottlenecks and gradient flow issues
    - CNNs have limited receptive fields and struggle with long-range dependencies
    - GRUs still suffer from sequential processing limitations
    - While residual connections help with training depth, they weren't the core innovation that enabled the Transformer's success

  <div className="question">
    In the self-attention mechanism, what are the three main matrices computed from the input embeddings?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about the database analogy: you have something you're looking for, something to match against, and something to retrieve.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Self-attention computes three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The attention weights are calculated as softmax(QK^T/âˆšd_k), which are then used to weight the Value matrix. This allows the model to determine which parts of the input to focus on.

    ![Self-Attention Mechanism Diagram](./self-attention-diagram.webp)
    *Visual breakdown: Input tokens flow through linear transformations to create Q, K, V matrices. The attention weights (shown as heatmap) determine how much each token should focus on every other token.*

    **Database analogy:** Query is "what you're looking for," Key is "what to match against," and Value is "what to retrieve" when there's a match.

    **Key insight:** Unlike RNNs that process sequentially, self-attention allows every token to directly interact with every other token in parallel, enabling much more efficient training and better capture of long-range dependencies.

    Why do Transformers use multi-head attention instead of single-head attention?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Consider what happens when you have multiple "perspectives" on the same data.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Each head can learn to focus on different types of relationships (syntactic, semantic, positional, etc.), providing richer representations than a single attention head could capture.

    **Why other explanations miss the mark:**
    - It's not about multiple languagesâ€”each head processes the same input language
    - It doesn't reduce computational complexityâ€”it actually increases it
    - Decoder attention masking is separate from the multi-head mechanism
    - While it provides some ensemble-like benefits, that's not the primary purpose

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about what makes RNNs naturally position-aware versus how self-attention operates.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Unlike RNNs that process sequences step-by-step, Transformers process all positions in parallel through self-attention. This means they have no inherent understanding of sequence order, so positional encodings (using sine/cosine functions or learned embeddings) must be added to give the model information about token positions.

    **Why other explanations fall short:**
    - Transformers explicitly don't process sequentiallyâ€”that's their key advantage for parallelization
    - Position information requires explicit encoding; it doesn't emerge automatically from standard training
    - Word embeddings are position-agnostic by design
    - Attention weights reflect content relationships, not inherent positional structure
    - Layer norm and residual connections help with gradient flow but don't provide positional information

  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Consider what "decoder-only" means for the attention pattern and prediction task.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    GPT-style models are trained with causal language modeling, where the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence given all previous tokens. This self-supervised approach allows models to learn rich language representations from large amounts of unlabeled text data.

    **Key distinction:** While BERT uses masked language modeling (bidirectional), GPT uses causal/autoregressive prediction (unidirectional), which makes it naturally suited for text generation tasks.

  <div className="question">
    Which statement **MOST accurately** describes the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Pre-training involves training a model on massive amounts of general text data to learn language representations. Fine-tuning then adapts this pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains using smaller, task-specific datasets. This transfer learning approach is more efficient than training from scratch for each task.

    **Why other options are incorrect:**
    - Fine-tuning comes after pre-training, not before
    - Fine-tuning typically uses different (often lower) learning rates and task-specific objectives
    - Pre-training requires vastly more compute due to dataset size and training time
    - Fine-tuning updates most/all parameters, not just the final layer
    - Fine-tuning builds on pre-training weights rather than replacing them

    What is RLHF and why is it critical in modern LLM development?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about the alignment problem and how human preferences get incorporated into model training.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a training technique where human evaluators rank model outputs, and this feedback is used to train a reward model. The LLM is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning to maximize this reward, helping align the model's behavior with human preferences and values.

    **The three-stage process:** 1) Supervised fine-tuning on high-quality demonstrations, 2) Training a reward model on human preference data, 3) RL optimization using PPO or similar algorithms to maximize the learned reward.

    This addresses the critical alignment problem where models trained purely on next-token prediction may learn to be helpful but not necessarily honest or harmless.

  <div className="question">
    What do scaling laws in LLMs tell us about the relationship between model size and performance?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Consider the Chinchilla paper and what it revealed about optimal compute allocation.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Scaling laws, as described by researchers like Kaplan et al. and Hoffmann et al. (Chinchilla), show that LLM performance scales predictably with three factors: compute budget, dataset size, and model parameters. These follow power-law relationships, suggesting that larger models trained on more data with more compute will generally perform better, though with diminishing returns.

    **Key insight:** The Chinchilla paper showed that many large models were undertrainedâ€”optimal performance requires balancing model size with training data, not just scaling parameters.

    **Why other options miss the mark:**
    - There's no clear plateau at 1B parameters; improvements continue at much larger scales
    - Overfitting isn't the primary concern with proper regularization and enough data
    - Scaling laws apply broadly across domains, not just vision
    - The relationship is power-law (sublinear), not linear
    - Recent models like GPT-4 and PaLM show scaling laws continuing beyond 10B

    Which tokenization method is **MOST commonly** used in modern LLMs like GPT and BERT?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about the balance between vocabulary size, semantic meaning, and handling unknown words.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and its variants (like SentencePiece) are the most common tokenization methods in modern LLMs. BPE starts with characters and iteratively merges the most frequent pairs, creating subword units that balance vocabulary size with meaningful semantic units, handling out-of-vocabulary words better than word-level tokenization.

    **Advantages of BPE:**
    - Handles rare/unknown words by breaking them into known subwords
    - Keeps vocabulary size manageable (typically 30K-50K tokens)
    - Preserves semantic relationships better than pure character-level
    - Language-agnostic and doesn't require linguistic knowledge

    **Why other methods are less common:**
    - Word-level creates huge vocabularies and can't handle unknown words
    - Character-level requires much longer sequences and loses semantic chunking
    - Sentence-level is too coarse for most language modeling tasks
    - Phoneme and morphological approaches require language-specific knowledge

  <slot name='hints'>
    Think about what "encoder-only," "decoder-only," and "encoder-decoder" mean for attention patterns.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Different transformer models use different architectural patterns: BERT uses encoder-only (bidirectional attention), GPT uses decoder-only (causal/autoregressive), and T5 uses encoder-decoder architecture. Each design choice makes them suitable for different tasksâ€”BERT for understanding, GPT for generation, and T5 for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

    **Architecture breakdown:**
    - **BERT (encoder-only):** Bidirectional attention, good for classification/understanding tasks
    - **GPT (decoder-only):** Causal attention, optimized for text generation
    - **T5 (encoder-decoder):** Encoder has bidirectional attention, decoder has causal attention, good for translation/summarization
    - **PaLM:** Actually decoder-only like GPT, not encoder-decoder

    **Why other statements are wrong:**
    - BERT uses encoder-only with bidirectional attention, not decoder-only with causal masking
    - GPT uses decoder-only with causal attention, not encoder-only with bidirectional
    - Each architecture is optimized for different use casesâ€”they're not identical

  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting input prompts to elicit desired behaviors from pre-trained language models. This includes techniques like few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and instruction following to maximize model performance without additional training.

    **Key techniques include:**
    - **Few-shot prompting:** Providing examples in the prompt
    - **Chain-of-thought:** Encouraging step-by-step reasoning
    - **Role prompting:** Having the model adopt a specific persona
    - **Template design:** Structuring inputs for consistency

    **Why it matters:** Since most users interact with LLMs through prompts rather than fine-tuning, prompt engineering has become a critical skill for getting reliable, high-quality outputs from these models.

    Think about what metric directly relates to the language modeling objective itself.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Perplexity is the standard metric for evaluating language models during training, measuring how well a model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity indicates better performance. It's calculated as 2^(cross-entropy loss), representing the average number of choices the model is uncertain about when predicting the next token.

    **Intuition:** Perplexity can be thought of as the "effective vocabulary size" the model is choosing from at each step. A perplexity of 10 means the model is, on average, as confused as if it had to choose uniformly from 10 options.

    **Why other metrics are less suitable for pre-training:**
    - BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR are for specific tasks like translation/summarization
    - F1 and accuracy are for classification tasks

    The term suggests something that seems real but isn't actually there.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Hallucination refers to when LLMs generate content that appears plausible and well-structured but is factually incorrect or not grounded in their training data. This is a significant challenge because the outputs can be convincing while being wrong, making it difficult for users to identify inaccurate information.

    **Why this happens:**
    - LLMs are trained to predict plausible next tokens, not to be factually accurate
    - They can confabulate details that "sound right" based on patterns in training data
    - They lack real-time access to factual databases or the ability to verify claims

    **Mitigation strategies:**
    - Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
    - Fact-checking and citation systems

    Think about phase transitionsâ€”sudden changes that happen when you cross a threshold.
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Emergent abilities are capabilities that appear in large language models at certain scales that are not present in smaller models and were not explicitly trained for. Examples include few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and complex problem-solving. These abilities seem to emerge when models reach sufficient size and training, suggesting phase transitions in model capabilities.

    **Notable examples:**
    - **Few-shot learning:** Learning from just a few examples in the prompt
    - **Chain-of-thought reasoning:** Breaking down complex problems step-by-step
    - **Code generation:** Writing functional programs from natural language descriptions
    - **Mathematical reasoning:** Solving multi-step word problems

    **The mystery:** We don't fully understand why these abilities emerge at specific scales or how to predict what new capabilities might appear with even larger models. This makes scaling both exciting and somewhat unpredictable.
