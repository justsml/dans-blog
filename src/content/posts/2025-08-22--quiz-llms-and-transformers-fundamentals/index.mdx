  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    The Transformer architecture's breakthrough was the self-attention mechanism, which allows models to directly attend to all positions in a sequence simultaneously, eliminating the need for recurrent connections and enabling much better parallelization during training.

    In the self-attention mechanism, what are the three main components that are computed from the input?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Self-attention computes three matrices: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). The attention weights are calculated as softmax(QK^T/âˆšd_k), which are then used to weight the Value matrix. This allows the model to determine which parts of the input to focus on.

  <div className="question">
    Why do Transformers use multi-head attention instead of single-head attention?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Multi-head attention allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Each head can learn to focus on different types of relationships (syntactic, semantic, positional, etc.), providing richer representations than a single attention head could capture.

  options={[
    {text: 'Transformers process sequences sequentially like RNNs'},

  <div className="question">
    Why do Transformers require positional encodings to be added to input embeddings?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Unlike RNNs that process sequences step-by-step, Transformers process all positions in parallel through self-attention. This means they have no inherent understanding of sequence order, so positional encodings (using sine/cosine functions or learned embeddings) must be added to give the model information about token positions.

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    GPT-style models are trained with causal language modeling, where the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence given all previous tokens. This self-supervised approach allows models to learn rich language representations from large amounts of unlabeled text data.

  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Pre-training involves training a model on massive amounts of general text data to learn language representations. Fine-tuning then adapts this pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains using smaller, task-specific datasets. This transfer learning approach is more efficient than training from scratch for each task.

    What is RLHF and why is it important in modern LLM development?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is a training technique where human evaluators rank model outputs, and this feedback is used to train a reward model. The LLM is then fine-tuned using reinforcement learning to maximize this reward, helping align the model's behavior with human preferences and values.

    What do scaling laws in LLMs tell us about the relationship between model size and performance?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Scaling laws, as described by researchers like Kaplan et al., show that LLM performance scales predictably with three factors: compute budget, dataset size, and model parameters. These follow power-law relationships, suggesting that larger models trained on more data with more compute will generally perform better, though with diminishing returns.

    Which tokenization method is most commonly used in modern LLMs like GPT and BERT?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) and its variants (like SentencePiece) are the most common tokenization methods in modern LLMs. BPE starts with characters and iteratively merges the most frequent pairs, creating subword units that balance vocabulary size with meaningful semantic units, handling out-of-vocabulary words better than word-level tokenization.

    Which statement about transformer model architectures is correct?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Different transformer models use different architectural patterns: BERT uses encoder-only (bidirectional attention), GPT uses decoder-only (causal/autoregressive), and T5 uses encoder-decoder architecture. Each design choice makes them suitable for different tasks - BERT for understanding, GPT for generation, and T5 for sequence-to-sequence tasks.

    What is prompt engineering in the context of LLMs?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Prompt engineering is the practice of carefully crafting input prompts to elicit desired behaviors from pre-trained language models. This includes techniques like few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and instruction following to maximize model performance without additional training.

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Perplexity is a standard metric for evaluating language models, measuring how well a model predicts a sample of text. Lower perplexity indicates better performance. It's calculated as 2^(cross-entropy loss), representing the average number of choices the model is uncertain about when predicting the next token.

    What does "hallucination" mean in the context of LLM outputs?
  </div>
  </slot>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Hallucination refers to when LLMs generate content that appears plausible and well-structured but is factually incorrect or not grounded in their training data. This is a significant challenge because the outputs can be convincing while being wrong, making it difficult for users to identify inaccurate information.

    What are "emergent abilities" in large language models?
  </div>

  <slot name='hints'>
  </slot>

  <slot name='explanation'>
  <div className="explanation">
    Emergent abilities are capabilities that appear in large language models at certain scales that are not present in smaller models and were not explicitly trained for. Examples include few-shot learning, chain-of-thought reasoning, and complex problem-solving. These abilities seem to emerge when models reach sufficient size and training, suggesting phase transitions in model capabilities.
