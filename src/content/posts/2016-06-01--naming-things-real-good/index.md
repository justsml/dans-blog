## Naming stuff: Object Oriented Basics

Let's look at Object/class design by example...

### The Situation

Have you ever designed a `data model` (in code, Sql, or excel worksheets)?
Does the following look familiar?

```
*** anti-pattern - don't copy-paste ***
* User
  - id
  - avatarUrl
  - name
  - email
  - password

* Agent
  - id
  - primaryPhoto
  - name
  - email
  - agentEmail
  - agentPhoneMain
  - agentEmailPrimary
  - agentPhonePrimary
  - agentAddressFull
  - agentCompanyName
  - agentCompanyAddress
  - *userEmail* - 'Pointer' to User table ^^^
```

### Where's the bug?

Well, technically there's no bug, simply data in need of re-organization.

**Does the following sound familiar?**

1.  Any change to your app will necessitate hours of arduous debugging.
1.  Any changing requirements will result in:

![schema refactor][schema_refactor]

Why is naming a field `agentEmailPrimary` _so bad_?

For starters, you are **not** creating an entirely new thing unto the universe. Over-specificity has some traps:

1.  'Locked' into highly specific name, means `agentEmailPrimary` probably make your views and related code **0% reusable**, and featuring annoyingly recurring bugs like:

- Data not syncing between tables (not obvious if `user.email` needs to propagate to `agent.agentEmail` or vice-versa - nevermind complexity of manually implementing where & how to enforce this 'logic' ...)
- Validation rules/logic are likely duplicated & inconsitent.
- Increasingly, your project will resemble a shaky Jenga tower.
- Fragility piles up with every single new file, as an extremely high attention to detail is required for even trivial changes

1.  `agentEmailPrimary` could mean a few different things. Avoid ambiguity with **shorter names**.

- Watch out for silly excess wording. `Primary`? Just leads to more questions: Is there a Secondary? Is it for their Primary Next-of-kin?

Enough words Dan, what should it look like instead?

### A Solution

```
// Consolidated Schema:

User
  - id
  - role: ['agent', 'lead', 'admin']
  - name
  - phone
  - address
  - email
  - password
  - company
    - name
    - address
```

I removed the `Agent` table, as it didn't contain fields which were unique to Agents. And the `User.company` object (with `.name`, `.address`) emerged once the naming was cleaned up.

Some guiding principles:

1.  Eliminate unnecessary tables. Do you really need to have a `statuses` table? When you could add a `status::VARCHAR(8)` field on the `User` table? It's ok, use the extra bytes per row.
2.  Try merge related tables. **Data**
3.  Delete redundant data collection (e.g. remove `ActivityLogs` table if replaced by an Analytics solution.)
4.  Try keeping **all field names** to a **single word/noun/pro-noun**. It's ok to rely on the context provided by the table. (e.g. `PersonalAccount.email` vs `BusinessAccount.email` - the context is provided by the table name.)
5.  There is **no such thing** as `Agent.agentEmail` or `Agent.agentPhonePrimary`. Period. Say it with me: "it's `email` & `phone`."
6.  By using Highly Specific Names, you cast-in-stone a specific level of `code-reusability` and `durability`, well, specifically **ZERO %**.
7.  You aren't doing yourself any favors with crap like this `User.profileSummaryEmail`. ðŸ’ž
